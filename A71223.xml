            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have Drunk deep in the Cup of Affliction, and we have all Pledged you; it is wholſome, though bitter; but let us pray to God to remove this Cup in time, for the dregs and lees are poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. You have learned by over-winding the ſtrings of Authority, how to tune the People of this Monarchy, without breaking their Patience hereafter. Moſt Princes deſire unlimited power, which is a Sail too great for any Veſſel of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to bear; though it be never ſo well Ballaſted with Juſtice, Wiſdome, Moderation, and Piety, yet one flarb or other will endanger the over-ſetting it. Thoſe Commonwealths are moſt ſtable and pleaſing where the <hi>State is ſo mixed</hi> that every man (according to his degree and capacity) hath ſome <hi>intereſt</hi> therein to content him. <hi>The KING, Sovereign Command and Power; The Nobility and Gentry, a derivative Authority and Magiſtracy;</hi> and <hi>all enjoy their Laws, Liberties, and Properties.</hi> God hath curſed him that removeth the Bound-marks of his neighbour: this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive curſe, Kings enlarging their Prerogatives beyond their limits, are not excepted from it. You may be pleas'd to take heed therefore of two ſorts of men, moſt likely to miſ-lead you in this point, Ambitious Lawyers, who teach the Law to ſpeak, not what the Legiſlators meant, but what you ſhall ſeem to deſire: To avoyd this ſnare, ſuffer your Parliament to nominate 3. men for every Judges place, out of which you may pleaſe to chooſe one, as in pricking of Sheriffs. For it is the people that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to their wickedneſs, you are above the reach of their malice. The ſecond ſort is <hi>Paraſitical Divines:</hi> Theſe Ear-wigs are alwayes hovering in Princes Courts, hanging in their ears.
<pb facs="tcp:36662:4"/> They take upon them to make Princes beholding to their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wreſting of the Text, to beſtow upon them whatever Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative the Kings of <hi>Juda</hi> or <hi>Iſrael</hi> uſed or uſurped; as if the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicials of <hi>Moſes</hi> were appointed by God for all Common-wealths, all Kings: as a good Biſhoprick or Living is fit for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prieſt that can catch it. Theſe men having their beſt hopes of preferment from Princes, make Divinity to be but <hi>Organon Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticum,</hi> an inſtrument of Government; and harden the hearts of Princes, <hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like: Kings delight to be tickled by ſuch venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, warrantable flattery. Sir, you have more means to prefer them than other men, therefore they apply themſelves more to you than other men do. <hi>Tu facis hunc Dominum, te facit ille Deum.</hi> The King makes the poor Prieſt a Lord, and rather than he will be behind with the King in courteſie, he will flatter him above the condition of a Mortal, and make him a God Royal. <hi>Sir,</hi> permit me to give you this Antidote againſt this poyſon; let an Act be paſt, <hi>That all ſuch Divines, as either by Preaching, Writing, or diſcourſing, ſhall advance your Prerogative and Power above the known Laws and Liberties of the Land, forfeit all his Eccleſiaſtical preferments</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>and be incapable ever after, and for ever ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed your Court.</hi> But above all learn to truſt in your Judgment: <hi>Plus aliis de te quàm tu tibi credere noli:</hi> God hath enabled you to remember things paſt, to obſerve things preſent, and by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them together to conjecture things to come; which are the three parts of Wiſdom that will much honor and advantage you.

The <hi>City</hi> is their cheif foundation, with which they keep a ſtrict correſpondency, and daily communication of Counſels. Upon this conſideration, they have lately put the Parliament Purſe into the Cities Pocket as aforeſaid; ſetled and inlarged the City Militia. Whereas all the Countries of <hi>England</hi> (being more obnoxious to injuries than the City) ſuffer much for want of ſetling their Militia; the Parliament not truſting them with arms, ſo much as for their own defence: An evident ſign, there is a farther deſign than
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36662:11"/> disbanding this Army. And becauſe the City Militia can onely keep in awe the adjacent South and Eaſt Counties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; therefore to ſuppreſs the remoter parts, and inforce them to obedience, they keep up ſome <hi>in-land Garriſons,</hi> and have the Scots and G. <hi>Poyntz ſupernumerary forces for the North.</hi> And in <hi>the West</hi> (under colour for ſending men for <hi>Ireland</hi>) they keep upon free quarter and pay of the Country, <hi>many ſupernumerary Regiments</hi> and Troops, moſt Cavaliers, at leaſt five times as many as they really intend to tranſport. Theſe are always going, but never gone, like St. <hi>George,</hi> always in his ſaddle, never on his way. Something ever is and ſhall be wanting untill Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi>'s Army be disbanded; and then (it is thought) the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe will fall off; and theſe ſupernumeraries ſhall appear a new modelled Army, under Presbyterian Commanders, you may be ſure, and ſuch whoſe Conſciences ſhal not befool their wits where any matter of gain appeareth; if this be not their aym, why did they not disband thoſe lewd ſupernumeraries before laſt Winter, ſince they might have raiſed as many men the ſpring following for half the charge their very free quarters coſt? and moſt of theſe ſwear they will not go for <hi>Ireland,</hi> vowing they wil cut the throats of the Round-heads.</p>
                  <p>The Country is amazed, fearing theſe Cavaliers are kept on free quarter by a Cavaleeriſh party for ſome Cavaleeriſh deſign. Secondly, why did they not rather divide Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> Army into two parts, one to go for <hi>Ireland,</hi> the other to ſtay in <hi>England,</hi> being already modelled, excellently diſciplined, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the viſible marks of Gods favour upon their actions? But to take a few for <hi>Ireland,</hi> a few for <hi>England,</hi> and leave a Coar in the middle to be plucked forth and disbanded, was the way to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them, and put them into mutiny, and thereby neceſſitate the Parliament to disband them all, and give an opportunity to them that ſeek it, to new modell another Army out of the aforeſaid Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernumeraries, more pliable to the deſires of the Presbyrerian <hi>Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:</hi> adde hereunto the cauſeleſſe exaſperating ſpeeches and aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions caſt upon moſt of the Army purpoſely, as moderate men think, to diſcontent them. Thirdly, If they have no intent to keep up an Army againſt the People, why have they continued the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary charge for another year, and inlarged it from 52000 l. to 60000 l. a moneth?</p>

                  <p>What King of <hi>England</hi> ever offered ſo great a violence to the fundamental Privileges of Parliament, as to deny them the Liberty of Voting <hi>I</hi> and <hi>No</hi> freely?

                  <p>Many Members were amazed at this Letter, and it was moved, <hi>That the Speaker ſhould command all the Members to meet at the Houſe the next day; and ſhould declare, That they ſhould be ſecured from danger: And that it might be ordered, That no more but the ordinary Guards ſhould attend the houſe.</hi> But theſe two motions were violently oppoſed with vollies of threats, by the aforeſaid Parties and others.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36662:29"/> Guards upon their doors, and a Regiment or two of Horſe in <hi>Hide Park,</hi> ready to make impreſſions upon the Houſe, in caſe things had not gone to their minds: diverſe of whoſe Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders walking in the Hall, enquired often how things went: prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, <hi>they would pull them forth by the Ears if they did not give ſpeedy ſatisfaction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus for the <hi>manner</hi> of paſſing that Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>matter</hi> of Argument uſed againſt it was (as far as I can hear) to the purpoſe following: It was alleged that the Force upon Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, 26. <hi>July,</hi> ended that day, that the next day being Tueſday, the Houſe met quietly, and adjourned: that upon Friday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Houſes ſate quietly all day, and gave their Votes freely, and ſo forward; the City having ſufficiently provided for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, that the tranſient force upon Monday, could have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the Houſes for time to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Supreme power of no Nation can avoid their own Acts by pretended force:</hi> this would make the Common people, the Jurors, and Judges, to queſtion all Acts done in Parliament, ſince one man can, and may judge of force as well as another: this were to bring the Records of the Houſe into diſpute: <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was never gotten nor confirmed but by Force: Force was three-fold, <hi>upon one, or both Houſes; or upon the King, in giving his Royal aſſent;</hi> neither could plead it: the Parliament is preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to conſiſt of ſuch men as dare lay down their lives for their Country.</p>
                  <p>When the King came with force to demand the 5. Members: When the City came down crying for juſtice againſt the Earl of <hi>Stafford:</hi> When the Women came down crying for Peace: When the Reformadoes came down in a much more dangerous Tumult than this of the unarmed Apprentices; yet the Houſes continued ſitting and acting, and none of their Acts were nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>That to make their Acts, Orders, and Ordinances void <hi>ab initio,</hi> would draw many thouſand men, who had acted under them, into danger of their lives and fortunes, who had no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to diſpute the validity of our Votes: we muſt therefore give them power to diſpute our Acts hereafter upon matter of fact; for to tie men to unlimited and undiſputable obedience to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36662:30"/> our Votes, and yet to puniſh them for, obeying whenſoever we ſhall pleaſe to declare our acts void, <hi>ab initio,</hi> is contrary to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. If to act upon ſuch Ordinances were criminal, it was more criminal in thoſe that made them. And who ſhall be Judges of thoſe that made them? not the Members that went to the Army; They are parties pre-ingaged to live and die with the Army; and have approved the <hi>Armies Declaration,</hi> calling thoſe that ſate, <hi>a few Lords and Gentlemen, and no Parliament:</hi> They have joyned with a power out of the Houſes to give a Law to, and put an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement upon both Houſes, a preſident never heard of before, of moſt dangerous conſequence, it takes away the liberty of giving <hi>I</hi> and <hi>No</hi> freely, being the very life of Parliaments: If all done under an actual force be void, it it queſtionable whether all hath been done this four or five years be not void; and whether his Majeſties Royal aſſent to ſome good Bils paſſed this Parliament, may not be ſaid to have been extorted by force. If the Kings partie prevail, they will declare this Parliament void, upon the ground your ſelves have laid.<note place="margin">

                     </note>Next, <hi>Corbet</hi> reported, <hi>he had a Witneſs who depoſed that a Gentleman with a Red head had ſigned many Warrants, ſuppoſed to be</hi> Maſter <hi>Edward Baynton;</hi> at length after much wyer-drawing of the buſineſs, one Warrant was ſhewn to Maſter <hi>Baynton,</hi> which he confeſſed to be his hand.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36662:31"/> ſhall be but to as many ſeveral anſwers as ſeveral new matters of Charge come in against him, and ſhall day by day be liable to new vexations, and never know when he hath cleared himſelf.</hi> But <hi>Corbet</hi> (who of an examiner was now become the Kings Solicitor, or Advocate Criminal) moved to proceed to Judgement againſt him: but firſt to aske him ſome preparatory queſtions. But it was anſwered, that it was illegal to ſqueeſe examinations out of a mans own mouth; neither was a man bound to anſwer, where his words may condemn, but not abſolve him: for ſo much as depends upon the teſtimony of Witneſſes againſt this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, you cannot proceed unleſs he be by, and have liberty to put croſs queſtions to the Witneſſes. It is alleged, Warrants were ſigned, and all done in relation to a new War. It is anſwered, it was done in order to Self-defence (allowed by the Laws.) Long before this occaſion, when the Army firſt mutinied and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to march up to <hi>London,</hi> and uſe ſuch extraordinary means againſt the <hi>Parliament and City</hi> as God had put into their hands, you then in a full and free Parliament appointed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Safety for your defence, who ſate and acted. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee was but the ſame revived, and upon the like or worſe threats and menaces, as by the many printed papers from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my will appear; you have no Teſtimony againſt this Gentleman by name, but only a character of his Hair: and for ſigning the Warrant confeſſed by himſelf he is acquitted by the <hi>Proviſo</hi> of the Ordinance 20 <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, which excepted only ſuch as acted upon the force; but when the Committee of Safety was revived, the Parliament was freer from force than it is now. Mr. <hi>Baynton</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, was adjudged to be ſuſpended the Houſe during pleaſure of the Houſe, which is as much as to ſay, <hi>So long as the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of this Domineering Faction laſteth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 4 of <hi>Sept. Corbet</hi> reported he had a Witneſs (but named him not,<note place="margin">Againſt Mr. <hi>Walker.</hi>
                     </note> becauſe they were but preparatory examinations) who depoſed, that an elderly Gentleman, of low ſtature, in a Gray ſuit, with a little ſtick in his hand, came forth of the Houſe into the Lobby when the tumult was at the Parliament door, and whiſpered ſome of the Apprentices in the ear, and encouraged them, (ſuppoſed to be Mr. <hi>Walker.</hi>) Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> denyed he ſpake then with any man in the <hi>Lobby,</hi> or ſaw any face that he knew
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36662:32"/> there; and ſo neglected the buſineſs as a thing not conſiderable. But the next day <hi>Corbet</hi> moved that Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> might be ordered to put on his Gray ſuit again, and appear before the Cloſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, and the Witneſs, who ſaith, <hi>he knoweth him again if he ſee him.</hi> I hear Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> deſired to know (ſeeing the Witneſs had not named him) by what Authority the examiners ſhould take ſuch a Depoſition, and make application thereof to him; And ſeeing there were many Gentlemen in the Houſe that day with whom that Character agreed as well as with himſelf, why the Reporter did not move that all to whom that Character was appliable might be put to that teſt as well as himſelf, but ſingle him out for a mark to ſhoot at; complaining, that he was not ignorant out of what quiver this Arrow came: he had been threatned with a revenge by ſome of that Cloſe Committee, and had other Enemies amongſt them, that could bite without bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He told them that yeſterday Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> reported that the ſuppoſed old man whiſpered, &amp;c. but deſired thoſe that were then in the Houſe to call to mind that the noiſe was then ſo great in the <hi>Lobby,</hi> that no whiſper, nay the loudeſt words he was able to ſpeak could not be heard. Then <hi>Corbet</hi> changed his Tale, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the words were, <hi>What you do, do quickly;</hi> and were ſpoken aloud; and ſaid the Character agreed beſt with Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> for that the Deponent ſaid, the Gentleman was a Lean meager man.</p>
                  <p>Here Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> deſired the Houſe to take notice, that the Reporter had twice varied his Report. 1 In the words ſpoken, from a <hi>whiſper</hi> to <hi>loud ſpeaking.</hi> 2 In the Character inlarged with the words <hi>lean and meager.</hi> Here is haile-ſhot provided, if one miſs the other muſt hit; Yet with this addition, there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Houſe with whom the Character agreed as wel as with himſelf. And by the incivility of his words, it ſhould ſeem the Witneſs is a man of no breeding; wherefore he deſired to hear his <hi>name,</hi> that he might inquire of his credit and repute. If the Reporter thinks he may be practiſed, he doth not think him a man of honeſty, and then he had more cauſe to ſuſpect him. He farther complained, that to make Hue and Cry after him (as it were upon freſh ſute) upon a Character of his perſon and cloaths five or ſix weeks after the ſuppoſed fact (he never having abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36662:32"/> himſelf one day from the Houſe) ſavoured too much of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty overſwayed with malice and revenge.</p>
                  <p>Your Cloſe Committee of Examination carry on buſineſſes ſo in the dark (being parties engaged with the Army, and not ſworn to be true in their office) that no man can ſee how to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or how he is dealt with, or when he is free from trouble and danger. It ſeems we are here called <hi>ex tempore</hi> to anſwer for our lives, <hi>ore tenus;</hi> and our Accuſation beginneth with the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of our perſons, to make us ſtate a Charge againſt our ſelves, to betray our ſelves, and cut our own throats with our tongues, contrary to <hi>Magna Charta, the Petition of Right,</hi> and all thoſe Laws of God and Man, which in the Kings time were in uſe; and no Witneſſes are produced, nor ſo much as named: me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks therefore we are compelled to play at <hi>blind-man bough</hi> for our lives, not ſeeing who ſtrikes us. You have the moſt ſummary way of hanging one another that ever I ſaw; it is a kind of <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber</hi> proceeding in matter of life and death; your ſecret Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations ſavours ſo much of the <hi>Spaniſh inquiſition,</hi> and of the <hi>Council of troubles</hi> erected by the Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi> in the <hi>Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> (called <hi>Conſilium Sanguinis</hi>) that they can never agree with the <hi>Laws and Nature of our Nation:</hi> if our Kings ſhall imitate you hereafter, they will be the greateſt Tyrants in the World. Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Privileges of Court, derogating from the common Rules of Law, and practice of the Land, are but curtains drawn before oppreſſion and tyranny to dazle mens eyes. Give me leave to tell you, that I have ſerved you faithfully from the beginning, and have taken as much pains, and run as many hazards, as moſt men in your ſervice, wherein I have loſt my health, and above 7000 l. of my Eſtate, without one penny compenſation, as other men have had; nor have I laid my hand upon any mans money or goods, or had any gainfull imployment from you; I contented my ſelf to ſerve my Country <hi>gratis,</hi> and with ſome little honour I had gotten thereby, whereof you have now robbed me, by a roaving Accuſation ſhot at random at me. Had I cheated the State of 40000 l. or 50000 l. peradventure I might have been thought a Godly, confiding man, of right principles, and have had 10000 l. given me for my pains. <hi>Sir,</hi> You have heard the voice of a Free-man (not of a ſlave) that dares keep his firſt Principles,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36662:33"/> Religion, Laws, and juſt liberties, whoſoever lays them aſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and proteſt againſt Tyranny and oppreſſion, whereſoever he finds it, whether in the Government of <hi>one</hi> or <hi>many.</hi> You may mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me by the Sword of Juſtice, but you cannot hurt me: but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from the evils to come. Nor ſhall I be unwilling to ſuffer a Gaol-delivery of my Soul from the priſon of my body when I am called to it.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> had done his defence, the debate followed much to this purpoſe, <hi>That to order him to appear in his Gray ſuit before the Cloſe Committee and Witneſs was illegal, and againſt the Laws and Liberties of the Subject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It is to help another to accuſe himſelf; which is all one as if he did accuſe himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>To bid a Witneſs look upon a man</hi> (after he is engaged to name ſome body) <hi>is to prompt him to go no farther than the party ſhewed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>A Witneſs ought not to be twice examined againſt a man,</hi> that is, <hi>to draw him on by degrees to ſwear home, and to mend in his ſecond Depoſition what fell ſhort in his firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>If the Witneſs depoſe to the matter, not naming the party, and five or ſix weeks after declare the Perſon without Oath, this is no Depoſition, and if the Oath be renewed, the Witneſs is twice exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi> So the buſineſs was laid by, and <hi>Corbet</hi> allowed to ſhew Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> caſually as he could meet with him to his Witneſs, which was (in a manner) to draw dry-foot after him with his blond-hound.</p>
                  <p>I was the more curious in gathering the circumſtances of this buſineſs out of the reports of many ſeveral men, in regard of the rareneſs of the caſe, and the exquiſitneſs of the malice with which it was proſecuted. And it ſeemed to me the more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe I hear generally that Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> hath always been oppoſite to all parties and factions, both <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,</hi> upon whom he looks as the common diſturbers both of Church and Commonwealth, and enemies of peace. Nor could he ever be perſwaded to be at any of their <hi>Junto's</hi> or ſecret mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and therefore it is not probable he ſhould ſuddenly and in the open view of the Houſe go forth and engage with a company of ſilly unarmed Apprentice Boys. But I hear they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure his ſeverity, nor he their knavery. What will not the malice
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36662:33"/> of a deſperate Anabatiſtical faction attempt? they have long ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the blood and treaſure of the Land, as the <hi>Leviathan</hi> doth in the Waters; and do now keep up a numerous Army to carry on thoſe deſigns by force, which they can no longer make good by fraud. All <hi>England</hi> is become as <hi>Munſter</hi> was, and our <hi>Grandees</hi> ſuitable to <hi>John of Leyden</hi> and <hi>Knipperdoling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next report <hi>Corbet</hi> made concerning Mr. Recorder <hi>Glyn.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Againſt Mr. Recorder <hi>Glyn.</hi>
                     </note> The chief things objected were, <hi>That he had frequented the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council, the Committees of the Militia, and Safety, more than he was want to do: That he was ſilent and made no oppoſition; and that he gave thanks to the Apprentices when they delivered their Petition to the City, offering their help for defence thereof againſt whomſoever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Recorder anſwered, <hi>The Charge was long, and his Memory ſhort: He deſired time to examine his memory, concerning the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time, place, perſons and other matters; and that he might examine Witneſſes for clearing his innocency.</hi> But his proſecutors (hoping to do more good upon him by way of Surprize, than in a deliberate and legal way of proceeding) put him upon it to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <hi>ex tempore.</hi> He confeſſed and avoided ſome things, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the moſt material. He denied he was more frequent at their meetings than ordinary. For his ſilence, he alleged, he was but the Cities ſervant, and had no voice amongſt them, but when his opinion was demanded: That he gave thanks to the Apprentices as a ſervant by command, yet had mixed ſome admonitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions in his Speech to them.</p>
                  <p>So the Recorder withdrew. And preſently <hi>Haſlerig</hi> (according to his cuſtom) moved judgment might be given againſt him. To which was anſwered, that the Recorder denied the principal parts of his Charge; and offered proofs by Witneſſes: you muſt give him that leave, or take all parts of his ſpeech for granted; as well that makes for him, as againſt him. Two or three days more will make this buſineſs ripe for judgment: let him have one judgment for all. If you judge him now to be expelled the Houſe, he is already fore judged, and that will be a leading caſe to a farther judgment: for who dares acquit where you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned? A man ought to be but once judged upon one accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The diſhonour of expulſion is a puniſhment exceeding
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36662:34"/> death. If you judge now upon one part of the Accuſation, and hereafter upon another part of the Accuſation, he will be twice condemned upon one Accuſation, and ſhall never know when he hath ſati fied the Law, an endleſs vexation.</p>
                  <p>Yet <hi>Haſlerig</hi> moved he might receive judgment now, for what was already proved or confeſſed, to be expelled the Houſe, (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The Lords went on without obſtruction in their buſineſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had purged their Houſe</hi>) and that he might be farther impeached hereafter upon farther hearing. So he was adjudged to be diſcharged the Houſe, committed to the Tower, and farther im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached hereafter.</p>

                     </note>Sir <hi>John Maynnrd</hi> the ſame day was called to Anſwer.

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>For the three Reaſons aforeſaid, the Houſe of Peers is no Court of Judicature, without the Kings ſpecial Authority granted to them, either by his Writ, or his Commiſſion; and the Lords by their four Votes having denied all further addreſs or application to the King, have cut off from themſelves that fountain from which they derived all their power; and all trials by Commiſſion muſt be upon Bills or Acts of Attainder, not by <hi>Articles of Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> a way never heard of before this Parliament, and invented to carry on the deſigns of a reſtleſs impetuous faction: Had the Faction had but ſo much wit as to try the Gentlemen by Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Oyer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>The Presbyterian Party argued, that the engagement of the Army ought to be no rule to the Counſels of the Parliament; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe new engagements every day may preſcribe the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment new Rules; we muſt look two wayes. 1 Upon the people unable to bear the burthen. 2.

In the third year of King CHARLS, the Lords
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36662:38"/> and Commons in their Petition of Right (when not above 2000. or 3000.

Yet now we are ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more oppreſſed with them, and if theſe quarterers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer violence or villanous uſage to any man in his houſe or family, or commit murder or felony, they are protected againſt the Laws and Juſtice of the Land, and <hi>Triable only by a Council of War</hi> at the Head-quarters, where a man can neither obtain juſtice, nor ſeek it with ſafety.<note place="margin">59. Martial Law.</note> So that we live under the burthen of a perpetual Army of 30000. or 40000. men, exempt from all but Martial Law, which frequently oppreſſeth, ſeldom righteth any man: witneſs <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi>'s taking of <hi>Tompſon</hi> (being no Souldier) from the Houſe of Commons door with Souldiers, impriſoning and condemning him at a Council of War, where he ſate Judg in his own cauſe, there being a quarrel between them; yet it was held Treaſon in the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> to condemn the Lord of <hi>Valentia</hi> ſo, being a Member of his Army, becauſe it was in time of Peace, as this was. Many other examples we have of the like nature, and of this Army, enough to perſwade us, that theſe <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative Saints</hi> will not govern by the known Laws of the Land, (for which they have made us ſpend our money and blood) but by Martial Law, and Committee Law, grounded upon Arbitrary Ordinances of Parliament, which themſelves in the firſt part of <hi>exact Collections,</hi> p. 727. confeſs, are not laws without the Royal aſſent.</p>
                  <p>This Army hath been dayly recruited without any Authority, far beyond the ſaid number or pay eſtabliſhed; the ſupernume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries living upon free-quarter; and when complaints have been made thereof in the Houſe, the Army being quartered in ſeveral Brigades, ſupernumeraries have been disbanded in one brigade, &amp; their Arms taken by their Officers,<note place="margin">60.

                  <p>Theſe Grandees have cheated all the intereſts of the Kingdom, and have lately attempted the City again, and had the repulſe.

                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry Milmay</hi> made a long Speech in praiſe of <hi>Argyle;</hi> ſaying, <hi>That he and his party, and the Scotiſh Clergy, were the onely men that upheld the Engliſh interest in</hi> Scotland, <hi>and were better friends to us than all</hi> Scotland <hi>beſides:</hi> wherefore he moved, that <hi>Argyle</hi> might be paid his 10000 l. and the reſt continued at inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, at 8 l. <hi>per cent.</hi> Preſently the whole Independent gang, with much zeal, and little diſcretion, ran that way, untill more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men ſtopping them in full cry, minded them what diſhonour and danger they might bring their friend into by laying him open to ſuſpition.</p>

                  <p>The Houſe of Commons (upon this occaſion) gave 1000 l. to the Souldiers for their valorous exploit, and Voted 1000 Foot, and 100 Horſe to be kept in the <hi>Tower.</hi> The Garriſons of <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> and the <hi>Mewes</hi> to be ſtrengthened: 3 Barges capable of 50 Muſquetiers apiece to lie at <hi>Whitehall</hi> for the Souldiers to convey themſelves to any landing place to diſperſe ſuch watermen as ſhal aſſemble: The City Chains to be taken away from their Poſts, and a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> to iſſue forth to murder more of theſe Children legally.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That by Ordinance of both Houſes, all men were enjoyned to take the National Covenant.

It was moved that Offenders of this kind might be bound to the good behaviour, and the offences proved openly at the Aſſizes or Seſſions, before ſo deſtructive a puniſhment be inflicted. There are three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in Law, of which the Laws are very tender, and will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be touched but upon great Offences, cleer proofs, and exact formalities obſerved, <hi>life, liberty,</hi> and <hi>eſtate:</hi> by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> and many other Statutes, theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are ſo ſacred, that nothing but the Law can meddle with them, <hi>Nemo impriſonetur aut diſſeiſietur niſi per legale judicium parium ſuorum.</hi> You have made the people ſhed their money and blood abundantly, pretending defence of <hi>Religion, Laws,</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties;</hi> let them now at laſt (being a time of peace) enjoy what they have ſo dearly paid for; and delay them not with a pretended neceſſity of your own making; you now make all that is, or can be neer and deer to them, liable to the paſſions of three Committee-men, to judge and execute according to their diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without Law, or ſo much as a formality thereof: And yet both Houſes of Parliament have often heretofore offered to aboliſh thoſe Committees, as men whoſe wickedneſſe and folly they and the whole Kingdom were aſhamed of. The Grandees of the Parliament and Army, when the Houſes are called, and full, have reſolved to draw their forces neer about the Town, and by that terrour to trie the temper of the Houſes; ſuch Members as will not comply with them, they will with freſh Charges purge out of the Houſe, and publiſh baſe and infamous ſcandals againſt them, to which if they ſubmit with ſilence, they betray their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations for ever, and ſpare the credits of their jugling enemies.

                     </gap>e accordingly. The Letter to the ſaid Speaker had a copy of another Letter enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in it, to the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> which bore date 1 <hi>June,</hi> 1648. to this purpoſe, <hi>Giving his Lordſhip to underſtand, That upon pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conference with Captain</hi> ROLF (<hi>a man very intimate with Colonel</hi> Hammond, <hi>and high in the eſteem of the Army) the ſaid Captain</hi> Rolf <hi>told him</hi> (the ſaid <hi>Osburn) that to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> Hammond <hi>had received ſeveral Letters from the Army, adviſing him to remove the</hi> KING <hi>out of the way by Poyſon, or any other means, for it would much conduce to their affairs. But</hi> (ſaid <hi>Rolf</hi>) Hammond <hi>had a good allowance for keeping the</hi> KING, <hi>and is therefore unwilling to loſe ſo beneficial an imployment. But</hi> (ſaith Rolf) <hi>if you will joyn with me, we will endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey away the</hi> KING <hi>to ſome ſecret place, and we may then do what we will with Him. Osburn</hi> offers in his ſaid Letter, <hi>That if he may come and go with ſafety, he would come and juſtifie the ſame upon Oath.</hi> He likewiſe writ to the Speaker of the Lords Houſe about it. Then was read <hi>Osburn's</hi> Letter to Mr. <hi>Lenthall</hi> Speaker, dated 10. <hi>June</hi> 1648. containing the ſame Narration, with an offer to appear, and make it good upon Oath if he might come and go with ſafety and freedom. The Clerk had no ſooner done reading this Letter, but with a ſlight neglect, and the laughter of ſome Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the buſineſſe was paſſed over without debate, and Mr. <hi>Scawen</hi> ſtood up to propound a new buſineſſe from the Army; when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> interrupting <hi>Scawen,</hi> deſired to ſpeak a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Letter came, and who brought it?</hi> the Speaker called upon the Sergeant of the Mace, who Anſwered, <hi>The Letter was given him at the door by a man that he knew not; that he had many Letters and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:36662:56"/> Papers thruſt upon him of which he could give no account, but he would endeavour to find the Meſſenger.</hi> Then Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> urged that <hi>ſuch an information coming to the Houſe ought not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected whether true or falſe, but to be examined and ſifted to the bottom. If the</hi> KING <hi>ſhould die a naturall death, or any miſchance befall him, (the People calling to mind how little care we had taken of his ſafety) would never be ſatisfied with our proteſtation;</hi> and moved, <hi>that a Committee might be named to examine</hi> Osburn, Rolf, Hammond, <hi>and ſuch others whoſe names ſhould occur in the Examination.</hi> This was ſeconded by Sir <hi>Simond Dewes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hungerford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edward Stevens,</hi> and ſome others, who preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it farther, but received a ſlight Anſwer. <hi>That thoſe that deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to examine the buſineſſe knew not where to find</hi> Osburn. <hi>That</hi> Osburn was a Malignant, <hi>and had attempted to ſet the</hi> KING <hi>at liberty.</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> replied, <hi>That the other day we had named a Committee to examine the buſineſſe concerning the Foot-boy that ſtrook Sir</hi> Henry Mildmay, <hi>and yet we neither knew then where to find the Foot-boy, or what his name was. If we do but publiſh that</hi> Osburn <hi>ſhall with freedom and ſafety come and go, in caſe he appear to make good his Charge, either he will appear, or we ſhall declare him an Impoſtor, and puniſh him when we take him, and clear the reputation of thoſe upon whom this Letter ſeems to reflect. Conſider how vaſt a difference there is between beating a Subject, and Killing a King. And if</hi> Osburn <hi>(whom I know not) be a Malignant, yet unleſſe you can prove him a Nullifidian, or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon convict of Perjury, both according to the Rules of Chriſtian Charity, and in the charitable intendment of our Laws, his Oath is valid and good.</hi> Then <hi>Tho. Scot</hi> ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>That this preſſing for a Committee to examine this buſineſſe, was but a device to draw Colonel</hi> Hammond, <hi>and</hi> Rolf, <hi>up to Town to be examined, that the</hi> KING <hi>might the eaſier make an eſcape.</hi> And Sir <hi>John Evelin</hi> of <hi>Wilts,</hi> alleged <hi>that he conceived this was an invention of</hi> Osburns <hi>to bring the King to Town with Honour, Freedom, and Safety.</hi> Then <hi>Walker</hi> ſtood up again, but was interrupted by Maſter <hi>Hill,</hi> and not ſuffered to ſpeak, having already ſpoken twice. At the end of almoſt every motion made for a Committee to examine the buſineſſe, either Mr. <hi>Scawen,</hi> or Major General <hi>Skippon</hi> ſtood up and offered to divert the buſineſſe by new matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36662:57"/> the Army, which uſually beareth all other buſineſſes down before it. At laſt thoſe few that moved for an Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Information, having ſpoken as often as the Orders of the Houſe do permit, were forced to be ſilent; ſo the buſineſſe was buried in ſilence. I hear that ſome of the Lords called upon this buſineſſe the Monday following, being the 19 of <hi>June,</hi> and that the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> being asked, <hi>why he did not impart</hi> Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn's <hi>ſaid Letters to the Houſe?</hi> Anſwered, <hi>That as ſoon as he opened the ſaid Letter he received from</hi> Osburn, <hi>and ſaw his name at the bottom, he looked upon the buſineſſe as not conſiderable:</hi> yet he ſent the Letter to <hi>Hammond.</hi> Upon Tueſday, 20 <hi>June,</hi> The Lords ſent a Meſſage to the Commons; the firſt paper whereof concerned <hi>Osburns</hi> ſaid Letters: they deſired <hi>that forty days might be aſſigned for</hi> Osburn <hi>to come and goe with ſafety to make good his information.</hi> But Sir <hi>William Armine</hi> ſtood up, and deſired, <hi>That the minutes of two Letters prepared to be ſent into into</hi> Holland <hi>and</hi> Zealand <hi>concerning our Revolted ſhips might be firſt dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, as being of preſent uſe.</hi> And when the buſineſſe was ended, Mr. <hi>Pierpointe</hi> propounded another part of the ſaid Meſſage. So <hi>Osburn's</hi> Information was left <hi>ſine die,</hi> for that time, but ſince, the Lords have quickned it, and 40 days are given to <hi>Osburn</hi> to come and go with Freedom and Safety to make good his information; who is come, and avoucheth it; and one <hi>Dowcett,</hi> ſpeaketh much in affirmation of a deſign of <hi>Rolfes</hi> to piſtol the King. <hi>Rolf</hi> preſents himſelf at the Commons Bar with a Letter from <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> which denies the Deſign, and pleads <hi>Rolfes</hi> cauſe for him. <hi>Rolf</hi> denied it at the Commons Bar with a trembling voice, yet afterwards hid out of the way; but being diſcovered upon ſearch, he was found to have a Byle upon him, that diſabled him from riding, otherwiſe (it is thought) he would have fled far enough. I do not hear that <hi>Hammond</hi> is yet ſent for, or queſtioned. And for <hi>Osburn's</hi> indeavour to convey his Majeſtie from <hi>Carisbrook-Castle,</hi> it is alledged, he did it with a charitable intent to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his life, and not of any diſaffection to the Parliament, to which he hath been affectionately ſerviceable. Though many take offence at Maſter <hi>Walker,</hi> as if his ſtirring of his buſineſſe were onely to caſt an aſperſion upon the Army: yet (I conceive) that what he did was commendable, in diſcharge of the duty he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:36662:57"/> owes to God, his King, and Country, and of his truſt as a Member of the Repreſentative body of this Kingdom, and in performance of the obligations which the Oath of Allegiance, the Parliaments Proteſtation, the National Covenant, and the known Laws of the Land lay upon him, which duty he was bound to perform, (though with the extremeſt hazard of his life and fortunes) and though he may happily hope better things of this Army, yet ſince neither the Laws of the Land, nor common reaſon warrants him to preſume upon his own private hopes and judgment (things which often deceive the wiſeſt men in matters of far leſſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) he could do no leſſe than free his conſcience, by making the whole Houſe Witneſſes of the cleerneſſe of his actions and intentions.

In theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions he ſtileth himſelf <hi>(untruly) Commander in cheif of all the forces of the five Weſtern Aſſociat Counties:</hi> and gave authority and encouragement to the well affected (that is, to Independents, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries, Antimonarchiſts, and the more deſperate, forlorn ſort of people) to enter into, and ſubſcribe Engagements, <hi>to live and die with the Army</hi> (an imitation of the Members Engagement) <hi>in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Parliament,</hi> (that is, of the ingaged faction of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Schiſmaticks, and corrupt perſons, whom only the Army looks upon as the Parliament) witneſſe the Declaration of Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and his Council of War, ſhewing the grounds of his advancing up to <hi>London.</hi> This uſurpation was complained of in the Houſe of Commons, Monday 19. <hi>June,</hi> and prohibited then by Order.</p>
                  <p n="7">7.

That he had read of a Man, who being asked when he was young, Why he did not marry?

So he was of opinion there could be no time ſeaſonable for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Treaty, or a Peace with ſo perfidious and implacable a Prince; but it would always be too ſoon or too late. He that draws his ſword upon his King muſt throw his Scabbard into the fire.

                  <p>The ſaid 5 <hi>July,</hi> the Speaker, as ſoon as he ſate in his Chair,<note place="margin">100.

                  <p>For when they found they could not prevail to Adjourn,<note place="margin">101. <hi>Skippon</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to raiſe 1000 Horſe.</note> they moved for power to be given to Maj.

                  <p>And the ſame day Mr. <hi>Swynfin</hi> reported from the Committee of Safety, <hi>That they offered to the Conſideration of that Houſe,</hi>

                  </p>

                     <hi>If this Horſe Guard be raiſed, how ſhall we aſſure our ſelves they ſhall be Disbanded after ten days, being once under Command?</hi> It is therefore a ſubtile, malicious, tyrannous act, for the Committee of Safety to put ſo tempting a motion upon the Houſe, and give men cauſe to ſuſpect that ſomething of Deſign and Danger lies hid under it.</p>

                  <p>When this King went into <hi>Scotland,</hi> He compared the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth to a Watch, which they had taken in pieces; and adviſed them to keep every piece and pin ſafe, and put all in their right places again; but now all the principal pieces are either broken, or loſt.

So the Debate was reſumed: and <hi>Weaver</hi> went very high to try the temper of the Houſe. But the Debate <hi>in Terminis,</hi> That <hi>the Prince ſhould be declared a Rebell and a Traytor,</hi> was ſoon laid by (though violently preſſed) chiefly upon theſe reaſons.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. To Vote the Prince a Traytor the ſame day when they ſent Meſſengers to invite the King his Father to a Treaty of Peace, would argue no peaceable inclination in them, and would be ſo underſtood by the People.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They were engaged by the Nationall Covenant to defend the King's Perſon, Crown and Dignity; but the Prince, Heir apparent to His Crown, was (next under God) the chief ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter of his Crown and Dignity, therefore to Vote him a Traitor was to ſubvert his Crown and Dignity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By the Stat. 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. it is <hi>High Treaſon to endeavour the deſtruction of the Prince, the Kings eldeſt Son;</hi> but to declare him a Rebel and a Traitor, was to endeavour to deſtroy him; and therefore High Treaſon.</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:36662:69"/> Commons for Sequeſtrations had taken off a Sequeſtration from the Lands of</hi> Andrew Wall, for no other reaſon but becauſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Wall <hi>was Sequeſtred after his death.</hi> The caſe was diverſly argued; it was alleged, <hi>that in caſes of the higheſt Treaſon no man was condemned after death, becauſe he was not then in being to anſwer for himſelf, there could be no proceeding in Law againſt a</hi> non ens. In Felony <hi>if a man will ſtand mute, he forfeits not his lands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there wants an Anſwer,</hi> and yet it was his own fault not to anſwer. The Parliament is bound by all their Declarations made both to KING and People, and by the Nationall Covenant which contains all the firſt and juſt Principles of the Parliament, <hi>to defend the Laws and Liberties of the Land,</hi> and not to ſubvert them. Take heed of giving ſo dangerous a Preſident for Kings to act by hereafter againſt the People, and againſt this Parliament and their friends; ſince no man yet knows which way the tide may turn. But the Independent Faction (whoſe intereſt it is to keep themſelves rich, and all men elſe poor) argued the caſe meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon point of profit and conveniency, and neglected the right and <hi>jus</hi> of the buſineſſe.

Thus you ſee theſe greedy Canibal Saints (like the hungry dogs that ate <hi>Jeſabel</hi>) will devour carrion, or any thing that will make them fat and full: yet they declared, <hi>They were willing this Sequeſtration ſhould be beſtowed upon Maſter</hi> Copley <hi>as a Gratuity, not as a Right for fear of the example.</hi> Obſerve, that if Maſter <hi>Copley</hi> had waived his Title by Compoſition, and accepted this Wardſhip as a Gift, they would preſently have publiſhed it in their <hi>News books,</hi> and <hi>Gilbert Mabbot</hi> ſhould have proclaimed to all the world, that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:36662:70"/> Presbyterians and Independents might be thought alike guilty of impoveriſhing the Kingdom: for the Faction labours nothing more than to have Companions in their ſins and ſhames: At laſt it was paſſed, That Mr. <hi>Copley</hi> ſhould have the Wardſhip reſtored to him, but great care taken it ſhould not be drawn into example hereafter, that a man may not be Sequeſtred for Delinquency af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, <hi>Cavete vobis mortui atque ſepulti,</hi> dead mens graves are not ſecure from theſe <hi>Lycanthropi,</hi> theſe <hi>Lou-garons.</hi>

The third Vote read, was, <hi>That ſuch men of all profeſſions as the King ſhould ſend for, as of neceſſary uſe to Him in the Treaty, may be admitted to wait on him, and that He might be in the ſame state of Freedom He was in when He was laſt at</hi> Hampton-Court. This Vote (inſtead of concurring with the Lords) was divided. The firſt part (after many objections to it) was moulded into this following queſtion, and carried in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>that His Majesty might ſend for men of all profeſſions, and he being deſired first to ſend a Liſt of their Names to the Parl. and nominating no Perſon excepted out of Pardon, none that have been in Actual War againſt the Parliament, nor any man that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reſtraint of the Parliament.</hi> The latter part of this Vote, <hi>for enjoying ſuch Freedom as he was in at</hi> Hampton-Court, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly argued for the Ambiguouſneſſe of it; the queſtion being, <hi>Whether ſuch freedom as the Parliament allowed him, or ſuch freedom as the Army</hi> (for their own ends) <hi>gave him,</hi> de facto, <hi>were intended?</hi> at laſt the queſtion was agreed to be <hi>in Terminis.</hi> The fourth Vote, was, <hi>that the Scots ſhould be invited to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> this likewiſe was doubtfully argued, 1. <hi>Whether they ſhould be invited by the Parliament? conſidering they had broken the large treaty, National Covenant, and Union, by ſurprizing and Garriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> Barwick <hi>and</hi> Carliſle, <hi>and by entring</hi> England <hi>with an Army:</hi> This was carried in the Negative. The 2. Debate, was, <hi>Whether it ſhould be left to the King to invite the Scots to ſend ſome perſons au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to treat upon ſuch Propoſitions as they ſhould make for the Intereſt of</hi> Scotland <hi>only?</hi> This likewiſe was oppoſed for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aforeſaid, and becauſe the Power and Authority of <hi>Scotland</hi> was now in the hands of Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> and a few diſ-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons, who were not likely to ſend any of the honeſt God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly party to Treat, whereby the Treaty would be carried on
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:36662:72"/> to the diſadvantage and ruine of the Godly and of the Church, our only friends there: And Mr. <hi>Aſhurſt</hi> related, <hi>That the major part of the paſt Parliament of</hi> Scotland <hi>over-powred the minor part by an Army, and ſo got the Engagement and other Acts, and the Committee of Estates paſſed, againſt which the Aſſembly of the Kirk (conſisting of</hi> 400 <hi>perſons) declared with one Voice.</hi> I know not what he meant, by ſaying <hi>the major part in</hi> Scotland <hi>over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the minor,</hi> when I conſider that <hi>major pars obtinet rationem totius,</hi> the major part is virtually the Parliament, to which the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor part muſt ſubmit; although here in <hi>England</hi> the leſſer part of the Parliament engaging and conſpiring with an Army (whom themſelves in a full and free Parliament had formerly declared <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the State</hi>) overpowred the greater part, contrary to reaſon and practice. This queſtion ſeemed to agree with the ſenſe of the Independents reaſonably well, becauſe it leaves it onely to the pleaſure of the King to Treat diſ-junctively with the <hi>Scots</hi> upon the ſole Intereſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as men no ways concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſettlement of Peace in <hi>England;</hi> whereby it is tacitely inferred, that the Treaties, Covenant, and Union between the two Kingdoms is diſſolved, ſo the queſtion aforeſaid was put with this addition, <hi>That if the King ſhall be pleaſed to invite the</hi> Scots <hi>to ſend ſome Perſons Authorized, &amp;c. the Parliament will give them ſafe conduct.</hi> The fifth Vote of the Lords was, <hi>That</hi> Newport <hi>in the</hi> Iſland of Wight <hi>ſhould be the place of Treaty:</hi> to which the Commons concurred. With theſe debates ended this Week the 19 day of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>

                        <hi>1</hi> IT will never be ſafe nor honourable, for ſo great a City to accommodate and joyn intereſt with a conſpiring Party, that by frequent violations of their faith and duty, have inſlaved King, Parliament, City and Kingdom, and broken the Faith of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, given to the Scots in the large Treaties, and in the National Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2.</hi> By accommodating with them, you make all their crimes your own; their ſubtilty being to involve you to joyn with them in defence of their crimes.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>3.</hi> The Scottiſh quarrel is not against the Engliſh Nation, but againſt the treacherous and hypocritical Grandees, who by perjuring themſelves, and falſifying their ingagements both unto Kingdom and Army, keeping the Souldiers by falſe ſuggeſtions from disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and totally obſtructing <hi>Irelands</hi> relief; and alſo a conspiring party in Parliament, who keep them up to make good the aforeſaid crimes, forcing what Votes they pleaſe to paſſe, by over-awing the Parliament: Witneſſe <hi>Cromwels</hi> laying his hand upon his Sword, and forcing the Houſe to paſſe thoſe traiterous Votes againſt the King, contrary to their own Conſciences, Allegiance, Proteſtations, Vow and Covenant, and to raiſe Taxes upon the people, which they ſhare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves. This war is not like to be of any continuance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering there being in the Army many conſcientious men, who have had ſuch ample experiment of the falſhood of their Grand Officers, that they are not like to hazard their lives again under the command of ſuch Grand Impoſtors as they are, alſo knowing the General ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the Kingdom to them, under whoſe inſupportable burthens and oppreſſions it groaneth. Nor have we any way to break the power of the ſaid Grandees of this Army but by the Scots, whereby the just rights and Intereſts of all the three Kingdoms may be ſetled, and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> relieved; All which the Scots have declared in their former Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers delivered to both Houſes of Parliament.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <hi>4.</hi> If you accommodate with this faction, you muſt have the ſame friends and foes with them, as well as the ſame ſins and quarrels; and then it will grow to a Nationall quarrel between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which will be of long continuance and miſery: and the Intereſt of the King and his Children, and of all Princes of Chriſtendom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:36662:84"/> in the example, will be carried on in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> against you, if you joyn with thoſe beggarly Grandees, who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched themſelves, and their fellow-Impoſtors, by the ruines of the Kingdom. You will loſe your credit and intereſts with your friends and brethren of <hi>Scotland;</hi> the only fear and terror of whoſe coming into <hi>England</hi> kept this Faction (which all men know is never ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with money and blood) from taking many of your innocent heads from off your ſhoulders, and confiſcating your Eſtates to pay the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears of the Army: witneſſe their often ſpeeches to this purpoſe in the houſe of Commons, and their illegal and violent proceedings againſt you: you will likewiſe loſe all the people of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have ſhewed you your loſſes, let me ſhew you your gains by this accommodation, that by comparing one with the other, you may cast up your account whether you ſhall be gainers or loſers by it.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1.</hi> They offer you the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and your Militia to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored (things of no great conſideration) and your Aldermen and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to be ſet at liberty: they do not offer to disband their Army, which makes them Lord it over you, and over-power both Tower and Militia; and when they have divided you from all your friends, and deſtroyed your reputation, and are ſecure from the Scots, the ſame violence which at firſt took your Tower, your Militia and your moſt honeſt Citizens from you, can deprive you of them all again at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, when you ſhall have none to ſtick by you: your obligation to them ſhall be of ſteel, theirs to you but of ſtraw, he that gives me that he can deprive me of at pleaſure, gives me nothing.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2. Cromwell</hi> and his party knew your City to be the entire ſtrength of <hi>England.</hi> In <hi>Rich. 2.</hi> dayes (when it was not half ſo great and populous as now) it ſlew <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> and routed his rabble, ſix times as many in number as the Army. They therefore fear you, and conſequently hate you, and labour nothing more than to divide and weaken you, which is their proper intereſt: For which purpoſe (to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the City in it ſelf) they cauſed the Parliament to change your Militia into other hands: they cut off <hi>Weſtminſter, Southwark,</hi> and the <hi>Hamlets</hi> from your Militia, to weaken it; they have divided you from the Parliament, they have endeavoured to divide the Countrey from you, <hi>Ut dividendo ſingula imperent univerſis.</hi> Wherefore the Army in their Remonſtrance <hi>7.

                        <hi>3.</hi> Conſider you ſhall joyn with them that never kept Faith longer than they may gain by it, whereof you have many examples. Any honeſt man may be deceived once, but he is a fool that will be deceived twice by one man.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <hi>4.</hi> Nay you cannot treat with theſe men, nor give them a Common Council, or Hall, without loſſe and danger: they have always made lies their refuge, and built their Deſigns upon the ſandy foundations of Rumors and Fables.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Glover</hi> already give out, that they and you are as good as agreed, that you differ only upon a puntilio of honour, which will ſoon be reconciled: what is the meaning of this? but that they (having creatures of their own, Commiſſioners in <hi>Scotland</hi>) have advertiſement to ſpread the ſame reports there, thereby to take off the edge of your friends affections; to lay an imputation of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy upon you, and make you inconſiderable in the judgements of your beſt friends, and retard all indeavours for your ſuccour. In the mean time, this party hath blocked up all paſſages to <hi>Scotland,</hi> that truth can have no acceſſe to you, and you have only ſuch news as <hi>Derby-houſe</hi> doth pleaſe to impart to you. Theſe men have committed thoſe crimes that cannot be ſafe without committing greater: they muſt on headlong: go not with them for company; they deſire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow their plague-ſores upon others. Let it not trouble you, that the Parliament hath approved their ſubſcription of the Ingagement, with the Army; it was a Vote extorted in a thin houſe, many Members ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been driven away by threats of the Army before, and there were many diſſenting Members. A little patience and constancy will ſettle you in a laſting peace.</p>
                     <p>To petition the Houſes to repeal their four Votes againſt the King, is to ſave their reputation, that ſeek to deſtroy yours.</p>

                     <p>YOur Neighbours of <hi>Kent,</hi> and other Counties wiſhing well to them, take it unkindly, that (notwithſtanding all theſe former admonitions) you ſhould let down your chains, and give a free march to this bloody, cheating, ſchiſmatical Army at all hours of the night through your City, to cut their throats, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:36662:85"/> lend them 6000 l. to enable them to march: when they had no other deſign, but in a peaceable way to deliver a Petition to the Houſes, demanding nothing but what the Parliament by their Declarations, Covenant, the Oaths of Supremacy and allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the known Laws of the Land ought to grant: Onely, being fore-warned by the inhumane aſſaſſination of the <hi>Surrey</hi> Petitioners, they had ſome men in Armes, a ſufficient diſtance from the Town, to ſecure their Meſſengers. They have by their Letters to your ſelves and the Houſes manifeſted the clearneſſe of their intentions to you all. They are known to be men of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led habitations and fortunes (for the moſt part) not vagabonds and Souldiers of Fortune like the Army. Their commerce with you help you both to trade and feed: whereas the Armies inſolent march in triumph through your City, ſo far leſſened your reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ever ſince, that you conſtantly loſe in your trading 200000 l. a Week, and no Bullion comes into the Mint; whereby multitudes of you are undone, and yet the Armies Arrears, and all other Taxes are exacted from you with as much cruelty, as you loſt nothing.</p>
                     <p>Remember that Butchery committed upon the unarmed Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, when <hi>Cromwel</hi> cried to the Souldiers <hi>to kill man, woman, and child, and fire the City:</hi> at which time his Noſe looked as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly upon you as a Comet.</p>
                     <p>Remember the ſcorn put upon you by a Grandee when you were enabled to put up your Chains again; That the Houſe had conſented your Poſts ſhould have Chains as well as your Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and did as well deſerve them. And <hi>Weaver's</hi> word when your Guards came to attend the Houſe, <hi>that</hi> 60 <hi>of the Army ſhould beat</hi> 3000 <hi>of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Remember how unwillingly and juglingly they reſtored un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the <hi>Tower</hi> (firſt plundered of all its ammunition you former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had in it) and part only of your <hi>Militia,</hi> and that clogged with many reſtrictions: they that beſtow gifts ſo grudgingly upon you when they are weak, will deprive you of them again when they are ſtrong. Adverſity makes them your falſe friends, Proſperity your real Enemies, Neceſſity only ties them to you: have a care therefore you do not relieve their neceſſities, leſt you loſe them; like the frozen Snake in the boſome, when they grow warm they will bite and ſting.</p>
                     <p>You ſeem to have forgotten the unjuſt impriſonment of your Aldermen; the unfaithfulneſſe and inconſtancy of their Votes,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:36662:85"/> and Ordinances, even for ſecurity of Money, and Land bought; the ſeveral Informations and Teſtimonies you had of their good intentions to borrow more of your Money, not by way of Loan, nor upon the Publique Faith, but by way of plunder. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe injuries, and many more, (as if God had infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated you, to deſtroy you) you ſuffer a corrupt Faction within you to Liſt men (to the amazement of your neighbour Counties) whoſe principles you firſt examine; and if they be not <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> you truſt them not with Arms. I hear of a young man, who being asked, <hi>of what principles he was?</hi> he anſwered, <hi>That in theſe doubtfull times he profeſſed no principles but gain:</hi> to whom was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>then we are of one principle, for we are reſolved to keep what we have got.</hi> Behold the Principles of theſe men that obſtruct our peace! conſider that Heaven and Earth have denounced war againſt theſe men, and that God himſelf hath touched the hearts of all men as one man to riſe againſt them, and demand to have Peace, Religion, and Juſtice reſtored. When the whole Kingdom ſhall riſe in a flame, what will be your lot, but ſmoak in your eyes, and at laſt a conſuming fire in your bowels? when you only ſhall be left to maintain this domineering Army with your money, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit them with your blood? many of their Officers ſay already, <hi>That the Country is exhauſted of Money, and you ſhall be their purſe-bearers:</hi> but becauſe you are a curſt Cow, they muſt keep the <hi>Army</hi> about you, that the Souldiers may hold you by the <hi>horns</hi> whilſt their friends milk you.</p>
                     <p>Conſider how abſolute a neceſſity, and how general a reſolution there is, that all things ſhould return to their old channel: If you ſtop the violence of this Torrent, it will ſwell untill it overwhelm and drown you.

Gen. <hi>Cromwel</hi> anſwered, <hi>It was the better, for that would neceſſitate the continuance of our Army, which ſecures our perſons, will enforce our reaſons, make juſt our demands, and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate their grant; For the bloud, that will flow from the cheapveins of Common Souldiers, whereof</hi> England <hi>hath plenty, and we will not want; For the money,</hi> London <hi>is our bank, and from their Purſes it ſhall drain to our Coffers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Commiſſary <hi>Ireton,</hi> L. Gen. <hi>Cromwel's</hi> Son-in-law, ſaid, <hi>The work was half done; for we have already Voted</hi> no Addreſſes to be made to the King, <hi>and Him guilty of crimes enough to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Him, and by Impriſoning His Perſon, have fitted Him for a private life, and by it taught the people that He is ſubject to the diſpoſe of both Houſes of Parliament, whole Ordinances are only powerful by</hi> our Swords, <hi>and therefore our Actions ſhall be legal by their Vote. Further, the</hi> Prince <hi>(ſaid he) is link'd with his Father in crime, and therefore cannot be ſevered in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, he hath been General in a Weſtern Army, warring
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:36662:87"/> (as his Father) againſt the Parliament, a crime that as it rendred the Father fit to be Depoſed, ſo doth it the Son unfit to ſucceed in the Government. And that the deſcent of the Crown purge not him, (as it did</hi> Hen. <hi>7.) let us in the Fathers life time Crown the</hi> Duke of York, <hi>now in our power, whoſe tender years have preſerved him innocent, and preſents him fitter for protection and our deſign, and ſhould any blame our ſeverity towards the</hi> King <hi>and</hi> Prince, <hi>others will commend our clemency towards the</hi> Duke of York.</p>
                     <p>Upon the reſult of this Council, L. Gen. <hi>Cromwel</hi> in the Houſe of Commons, tels Mr. Speaker, <hi>That it was time to ſet on foot our great deſign, and that ſuch as ſhould not concur in Votes with us, be not continued of us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The motion being miſ-timed, and divers of his party abſent, it was only wondred at by Maſter <hi>Knightly,</hi> and died with the words. The Scene now alters from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to <hi>Carisbrook-Caſtle,</hi> and the King that could not be removed by <hi>Votes,</hi> muſt now by <hi>Poyſon,</hi> the Actor Col. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Major <hi>Rolf,</hi> &amp;c. all Members of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: yet must we by curſed <hi>Exciſe</hi> that inſenſibly devours the poor, by inſupportable <hi>Monthly Taxes</hi> that impoveriſh the rich, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law and our Allegiance, contrary to our Proteſtation and Covenant (inforced upon us) we muſt traiterouſly maintain and pay this Army that traiterouſly contrive and endeavour the depoſal and murder of our Soveraign Lord the King, the ſubverſion of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church, our Fundamental and known Laws.</p>
                     <p>We therefore declare to the World, that God bleſſing us, we will with hazard of our lives and fortunes, disband and diſſipate this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the Suppreſſors of the pure <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> the Impriſoners, and would be the Murtherers of their Soveraign Lord the King, and grand Oppreſſors of the Common-wealth; then free from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment our ſaid Soveraign, and him (God-willing) reſtore to his lawfull <hi>Government, juſt Rights, and Throne in Parliament;</hi> this done, we ſhall joyfully and readily, depoſite our juſtly aſſumed Arms, and on our knees beg what his Majesty hath often moſt graciouſly offered, and will undoubtedly grant, his moſt Royal and gracious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to all his miſ-led Subjects, will return to their Allegiance, and forward to <hi>bring the King back to his own houſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We therefore hereby earneſtly deſire and requeſt all loyal and wel-affected Subjects as well Members of both Houſes of Parliament as

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Covenant</hi> being at the firſt taking, held to be the true Touchſtone whereby the Religious Royal Subjects were diſcerned from all thoſe who were unwilling to ſubmit to the yoke of Chriſt in matters of Religion, or to the juſt and lawfull Government of our dread Soveraign his Vicegerent; now a ſubtil generation of men (or rather Vipers) in both Kingdomes, who did take the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and did magnifie it ſo long as it could ſerve them for a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to mount to their intended Greatneſs, being now at the top, have kick'd away the Ladder, and ſtanding (as it were) on the pinacle, look with diſdain on all their old friends, who out of the integrity of their hearts, did for the good of Religion, and His Majeſties honour, joyn in that ſolemn engagement, it being
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36662:94"/> far from their thoughts that their modeſt and humble deſires for the Reformation of ſome abuſes both in Church and State (all which, His Majeſty in the reſpective Kingdoms did (or was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to) cure) ſhould have ſtruck ſo deep as to endeavour the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of all lawfull Governments, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical; bringing, inſtead of a promiſed Reformation in Religion, a curſed Toleration of the moſt damnable Sects, Errors, and Hereſies that ever Hell did ſend forth; and for the Civil State, inſtead of a well-ſetled Monarchy, a moſt confuſed tyrannical Anarchy, quite contrary to the words and meaning of the Covenant, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt intentions of all true-hearted, Religious and loyall Subjects in the three Kingdoms, who did take that ſolemn Covenant with a purpoſe to keep it, and of very many thouſands who did never take the Covenant, (yet very good Proteſtants and loyall Subjects) being more affrighted with the compulſory way of enforcing it on all, than unſatisfied in the matter, being introduced in a legal way, none of theſe deſerving the name of Malignants, or to be ſo cruelly dealt with either for their perſons or Eſtates, as hath been too too common in both Kingdoms; but the Covenant it ſelf, doth beſt decypher who are Incendiaries, Malignants, and evil Inſtruments, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe who hinder the reformation of Religion, who divide the King from His People, or one Kingdom from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or make any Faction or Parties amongſt the people, contrary to the League and Covenant. Yet by our new tenets, none muſt be called Malignants but thoſe that have loyall hearts towards their Soveraign, though otherwiſe never ſo Religious, and all of them (with Maſter <hi>Martin</hi>) would gladly make the <hi>Covenant an old Almanack,</hi> that they might be rid of that tie of <hi>preſerving His Majeſties Perſon and Authority, in the preſervation and defence of the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdoms, that the world may bear witneſs with their conſciences of their loyalties, and that they have no thoughts or intentions to diminiſh His Majeſties juſt Power and Greatneſſe.</hi>

                  <p>As the <hi>Hiſtory of Independency</hi> hath diſcovered the practices of the <hi>Independent Junto,</hi> ſo this <hi>Appendix</hi> will diſcover their chief <hi>Confederate</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> namely the Marqueſs of <hi>Argyle;</hi> whoſe dealing with his Kindred, Friends, and Confederates mentioned in the following diſcourſe, will be a warning to all religious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, how they truſt ſuch an Apoſtate Covenanter, whoſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36662:94"/> and avarice hath ruined the KING, Church and State, or three flouriſhing Kingdoms. Although it may ſeem a paradox to many, I dare boldly aver, that <hi>Argile</hi> and his Faction in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> have been, and are the chief Malignants, Incendiaries, and evil Inſtruments, who have been the Ruiners of theſe three flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Kingdoms, and the Authors of the blood ſhed in all of them, as I hope by this following Diſcourſe will be made appear to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impartial and unprejudicate Reader, who hath, or may have the certain knowledge of every particular when time ſhall ſerve. This <hi>Argile</hi>'s Father, after the Marriage of his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving turned <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique, and this his only Son by his firſt Lady being carefully educated by the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> by whoſe means he obtained the poſſeſſion of his Fathers whole Eſtate for a ſmall Penſion, and by His Majeſties ſpecial favour (for out-quitting his pretended Title of <hi>Juſtice General (of the Kingdom of Scotland)</hi> did obtain an Heritable Juſticiary of <hi>Argile, Lorn, Kintyre,</hi> and many of the Weſtern Iſles; which power he did execute with that cruelty, that he diſguſted all the Iſlanders, and Highlands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who were never ſo tyrannized over by any of their Kings, till his Fathers death (ſtill fearing his return) he kept himſelf ſomewhat moderate for the engaging for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or keeping company ſometimes with thoſe that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; but his Father being dead, finding himſelf idolized by thoſe who had taken the managing of all affairs into their hands, and that by his power and policy he could prevail with them in any thing, to indear himſelf the more to that party, he did ſeem exceeding zealous for the Covenant, and pretending great fears from <hi>Ireland,</hi> (which the then Lord Deputy <hi>Strafford</hi> his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and known averſeneſſe from the Covenant, did make the more eaſily to be beleeved) whereas the true cauſe of his fears was for the loſs of <hi>Kintyre,</hi> (whereof he coſened his Brother long before his death) <hi>Iſla,</hi> and divers conſiderable Iſles which were and ought to be the poſſeſſions of the <hi>Mackdonalds,</hi> and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet provoking of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who in revenge of him did uſe very hardly all the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> who would not renounce the National Covenant of <hi>Scotland:</hi> he diſ-arming them, did Arm and Train many <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who (after his Head was off) ſhed ſo much bloud in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and upon pretence of divers of the <hi>Mackdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalds (Argile</hi>'s own Tenants for the time) were acceſſary to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36662:95"/> Plot, fearing his Judiciary power where he was both Judge and Party, they were inforced to flie to <hi>Ireland</hi> till their peace ſhould be made; to prevent which, he ſent their Wives and Children after them, took poſſeſſion of all their moveables, and placed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tenants in their Room; but being grieved that <hi>Culkettough</hi> and his Sons, who had goodly Poſſeſſions, were not gone with the reſt, he cauſed cite them before the Council, as acceſſary to an Invaſion to be made by <hi>Antrum</hi> and ſome of their friends; which citation (as legal men and not guilty in the leaſt) they did obey, and after ſome dayes ſtay in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> (taking their walk daily before <hi>Argile</hi>'s door) they did humbly intreat his Secretary to plead for them, that they might have a ſpeedy hearing, ſince they were weary of their attendance; which the Secretary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quanting the Lord <hi>Argile,</hi> returned them this Anſwer, That ſince they had teſtifyed their obedience by their appearance, they might go home and he have themſelves civilly, not medling with their Rebellious friends, (as he was pleaſed to term them) and be ready upon any new citation, they ſhould be excuſed for that time: they did humbly thank his Lordſhip, and his Secretary, for this courteſie, and did preſently depart from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> towards their home; whereof my Lord (by his Spies upon them) having notice, did immediately convene the Council, and whereas in many dayes before (during their ſtay in Town) they could not be heard, that day they were firſt Called, and upon their not Anſwering, my Lord aggravating their Accuſation by their departure, occaſioned by his own and his Secretaries contriving, procures a Warrant to make them priſoners till they ſhould be Tried, and to ſeize upon their Eſtates; which out of his zeal to the Covenant (God knows) he did carefully perform, and made <hi>Culkettough</hi> and his two Sons Priſoners before they were half way at home; which <hi>Alexander Macdonald</hi> (afterwards Sir <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Macdonald</hi>) being fled to <hi>Ireland</hi> (having no valuable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion to look to at home) did aſſociate himſelf with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in the beginning of their Rebellion; but ſo ſoon as the <hi>Scots</hi> Army came over, he did apply himſelf to them, aſſuring them that he would do them faithfull ſervice againſt the <hi>Iriſh Rebels,</hi> if they would releaſe his old Father and his two Brethren, unjuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained priſoners, or bring them to Legal Trial, whereof having aſſurance given him, he brought with him two hundred gallant
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36662:95"/> men of his friends, and did more execution upon the <hi>Iriſh</hi> than half of the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, their horſe being not able to follow through Bogs, and their Foot not ſo ſwift as the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and did in one morning bring in ſix or ſeven thouſand Cowes to the <hi>Scots</hi> Camp (the like booty they did never take at any one time before or ſince) for which good ſervice, the General did of new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for his Father and Brethrens releaſment; but when the Committee of Eſtates had conſented, <hi>Argile</hi> did reverſe all, and fruſtrate the Generals promiſe: which <hi>Alexander Macdonald</hi> perceiving, ſaid no more (but well) I will yet cauſe my faithful ſervice procure my Fathers inlargement, and did continue without pay, or hope of pay, ſaving a very ſpare allowance of quarters, until <hi>Argile</hi> ſent over and cauſed him to be diſcharged of all quarters, to the grief of all the <hi>Scots</hi> Officers, who did wel know what faithful ſervice he had done, and was able to do them: ſo that meer neceſſity did inforce him to make his peace with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> by whoſe help he did come over into <hi>Scotland,</hi> meerly to be revenged on <hi>Argile,</hi> and to relieve his Father, hoping the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of <hi>Scotland</hi> would not blame him for ſuing the performance of what their General had promiſed unto him, intending no more til <hi>Montroſſe</hi> out of his deſire to be revenged on <hi>Argile</hi> did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force <hi>Alexander Macdonald</hi> to joyn his Majeſties Intereſt, as <hi>Montroſſe</hi> pretended, with the ſaid <hi>Macdonald,</hi> hoping he would find (as indeed he did) a great many diſcontented perſons to joyn with them, all which, or the moſt conſiderable, were parties and perſons wronged, oppreſſed, and ruined by <hi>Argile,</hi> as chiefly (beſides the forementioned Iſlanders and theſe <hi>Highlands</hi> that were under his laſh) the <hi>Atholl</hi> men twice or thrice plundered by him; <hi>Montroſſe</hi> himſelf provoked by many wel-known in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, which no Noble heart could endure, as the death of Mr. <hi>James Stewart</hi> who was no Traitor either to King or Country ſave only to <hi>Argile.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Airly</hi> having his eſtate plundered, and his Houſe thrown down in revenge of an antient quarrel amongſt their Predeceſſors, for the Earl of <hi>Airly</hi> having ſome Lands in the Bray of <hi>Angus,</hi> out of which <hi>Argile's</hi> men did many times drive Heards of Cattle, Sheep, and other Beaſts, for which the Lord <hi>Ogilbee</hi> could have no remedy, theſe Thieves being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> by advice of his Lawyers he did Charge the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> that he ſhould find ſurety not to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36662:96"/> maintain or protect ſuch Out-lawes; but before he could obtain the ſame, he was obliged (according to the cuſtome of <hi>Scotland</hi>) to give his Oath, he did fear bodily harm from <hi>Argile,</hi> which he was unwilling to do; alleging, it were only a Beaſtly harm that he did fear, for if he would not protect thoſe that did ſteal his poor mens Beaſts, he was nothing afraid of his body. This tart Anſwer, after an age muſt (under colour of ſervice to the State) be ſo revenged.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gourdons,</hi> divers of whom he betrayed under truſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of ſecuring his Neces Portions that he was ingaged for, poſſeſſing himſelf of <hi>Badinoch</hi> and <hi>Lochabar,</hi> and plundring friends and foes indifferently in his marches too and fro, and the inexhauſtible treaſure of the <hi>Scots</hi> Exchequer muſt allow him ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or twelve thouſand pound ſterling for every Voyage; whereas his Breechleſſe Souldiery were well content with their Beef and Bannocks, and ſuch convenient plunder as the Country could afford: theſe (as I conceive) were the moſt conſiderable Forces <hi>Montroſſe</hi> ever had, unleſſe ſome that were through fear, compelled to yield for the time, ſo that the bloud-ſhed in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by <hi>Montroſſe</hi> and <hi>Macdonald</hi> do properly fall upon <hi>Argiles</hi> ſcore, no other under Heaven having occaſioned both their out-breakings, and all their partakers, who did ſee no other way to be revenged on him (that had made himſelf Maſter of all the Eſtate, having made <hi>Argile's</hi> quarrel their own) than by heaving at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecious pretext of the Kings intereſt: which if God in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had not prevented, they had almoſt effectuate through <hi>Argile's</hi> miſgovernment; wherein it is to be remarked, that when he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown by <hi>Montroſſe</hi> in <hi>Lochaber</hi> the ſecond of <hi>February,</hi> 1645. many of his friends being killed, and others taken, he who would not releaſe <hi>Culkettough</hi> for his Sons good ſervice, nor the Generals ingagement, or the Committee of Eſtates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire (you muſt not ſpeak of Command) for Maſter <hi>James Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel, who found more kindneſſe from <hi>Culkettough</hi> than from this Canibal Covenanter, is now content to releaſe all to get a poor Company of his Country-men, leaving the Godly Miniſter in cruel bondage, whom <hi>Culkettough</hi> did releaſe upon his Paroll and promiſe to ſend him a Boy that was forgot behind.</p>
                  <p>This religious Covenanter, out of his pious care for the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36662:96"/> of his Siſter, in the true Religion as he pretended, did by His Majeſties ſpecial favour overthrow the laſt will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Mother-in-law, by getting himſelf made Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the room of him who was nominated therein, whereby he got the Gentlewoman his Siſters whole patrimony into his hands; but before he could prevail in this, his Majeſty did take ſpecial care that ſufficient Surety ſhould be given that the Will of the Dead ſhould be truly performed by payment of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective portions when they were Married, and ſufficient main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance until they were Married: the Elder whoſe Portion was Five thouſand pound ſterling, is preſently ſent for, and one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound or thereby given to a Gentleman for his ſecond Wife, the reſt (there being a clauſe, <hi>that if any of them ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Nunneries, they ſhould only have</hi> 300 l. <hi>ſterling for all</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept ſo ſcarce of their due maintenance (the Gentleman who was ſurety, having advanced of his own above 1000 l. whereof he is not as yet repaid) were ſeduced to go to Monaſteries all ſave one, who is now ready to enter through his neglect; ſo this 12000 l. of his Siſters Portions (with the ruine of their Souls to boot) is a part of <hi>Argile's</hi> wel-made purchaſe.</p>
                  <p>The great care taken by the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> for <hi>Argile's</hi> edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and preſervation both of his life from the crafty deſigns of a Step-mother, and recovery of his almoſt ruined Eſtate, was ſo wel requited, that (notwithſtanding he hath the Earl of <hi>Morton's</hi> Daughter in his bed) in open Parliament he ſpake what became him not both of that noble Lords Perſon and Eſtate (only, as he pretended, out of his zeal to the welfare of the Kingdom) whereas the truth is, it was meerly out of his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have that Honourable place conferred upon himſelf, which was intended by his Majeſty upon that noble Lord; but finding His Majeſty not inclinable that way, the next aſſault was, for one of his own name, a man truly wel-deſerving (for to ſay, better deſerving than himſelf, is no great praiſe) and if, his two much favouring of him do not ſtain his reputation, worthy to be beloved.</p>
                  <p>Thus having ſhortly viewed <hi>Argile's</hi> religious carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Vaſſals and Tenants, Parents, Friends, and Allyes, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Siſters, Neighbours and fellow-Patriots, let us take a ſhort view of his Loyal carriage towards his Soveraign, and his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36662:97"/> due obſervation of the Solemn League and Covenant with his covenanted Brethren of <hi>England,</hi> and then let the impartial Reader judge whether he be not ſuch as is affirmed in the propoſition, the greateſt incendiary in the three Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be denied, but His Maieſty (as is mentioned before) did confer many great and Princely favours upon him at the Earl of <hi>Morton's</hi> deſire when he was Lord of <hi>Lorn,</hi> ſuch whereof as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired confirmation were approved and ratified in Parliament, His Majeſty being preſent, <hi>anno</hi> 1641. with the addition of the honour and title of Marqueſſe, and a full Penſion well paid ever ſince whoever want, together with (not only an <hi>act of oblivion,</hi> but) an approbation of all his tyrannical proceedings againſt the <hi>Athol</hi> men, the Earl of <hi>Airely,</hi> and others, though not particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, yet as done in obedience of Orders from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Eſtates (obtained by his own procurement) therefore to be no further queſtioned.</p>
                  <p>The firſt endeavour in requital of theſe and many other Royal favours was the entring in conſpiracy with certain his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates (whom I forbear to name) to transform the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> into a Free State like the Eſtates of <hi>Holland,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome truly noble Lords did abhor ſuch a diſloyal motion (after ſo many Acts of favour, witneſſing to all Poſterity his Royal bounty both to Church and State, whereof theſe chief Conſpirators taſted not a little) he did at that time forbear not ſo much to proſecute his deſign, as to conceal their Counſel from all theſe that had thoughts of Loyalty, though moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the true Religion and their Countrey, according to the Covenant. The <hi>Iriſh Rebellion</hi> breaking out, fearing his own ſtake if <hi>Antrim</hi> ſhould grow ſtrong, he procured one Regiment for himſelf, another for his Cozen <hi>Lawers,</hi> a third with the place of <hi>L. General</hi> for that moſt ungrate Gentleman the Earl of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> (who was married to his Neece and one of his Confidents, who was once heard ſay, <hi>That the</hi> 3 <hi>Kingdoms would never have peace ſo long as King</hi> CHARLES <hi>his Head was on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi> and yet it is only King CHARLES his favour that hath made him and his Father exceed the eſtate of Gentlemen) with many other places to divers of their friends, intending a ful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> (at leaſt) to baniſh <hi>Antrim</hi> and the <hi>Mackdonalds</hi> from thence, as he and his Predeceſſors had done many of them

But to come to the main point of the Conſpiracy, finding <hi>Scotland</hi> (although he had all the power of the Perſons and Eſtates in his hand) not pliable as yet to caſt off Monarchy, and imbrace Ariſtocracy, of whom (as affairs ſtood) none could be the chief Ruler but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he did imploy the Zealots of the Clergy to aſperſe thoſe who did oppoſe him (eſpecially ſome moſt faithfull and religious Noble men) as if they were fallen from their firſt love, turn, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

                  </p>
                  <p>Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> ſuffered his worthy Mother to enjoy, beſides her own Joynture, all his Estate, (whereby, indeed he loſt nothing, ſhe improving it much to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage) hath helpt his Brother to a great eſtate, with Titles and Places of Honour and profit, ſuitable to his birth and worth; his Siſters, and now ſome of his Neices matched in the Nobleſt and beſt Families of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whereas <hi>Argile</hi> did in his Fathers life time bring him to a Penſion, outed his Brother of his Eſtate, <hi>Kintyre,</hi> and ruined his Siſters by cheating them of their portions, and ſo enforcing them to go to Cloyſters.</p>
                  <p>The Duke had no quarrel with any ſave <hi>Montroſſe;</hi> the ground you heard, for croſſing his first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention for <hi>the Invaſion of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to prevent the miſery and bloudſhed that he did foreſee was like to follow.</p>

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:36662:100"/>
                  <p> The Duke had no ſpoyls nor gifts given him ſince ever he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Covenant (ſave the Title of D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>KE) but hath been spoyled both himſelf and friends by thoſe that followed <hi>Montroſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Argile</hi> had enrich'd his Country with the ſpoyls of the Kingdom, and himſelf with the great treaſure beſtowed on him both by <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> which is well ſecured without the reach of an Impeachment.</p>
                  <p>The Duke ſtands firm to his Covenant for the eſtabliſhed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, loyal to his Prince for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Government, faithfull to his Country against all forein Invaſion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Argile</hi> hath contrary to his Covenant, Duty and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, conſpired to extirpate Monarchical Government, to introduce forein forces of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to the utter overthrow of the eſtabliſhed Religion.</p>
                  <p>The Duke acts nothing but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws eſtabliſhed, according to the Covenant, and the duty of every good Subject.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Argile</hi> hath overthrown all Laws, tyrannizing over the Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates of the Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> hath been of that temper to mediate for a wel-grounded Peace, his Majeſties deliverance, and the Perſonal Treaty, being the only probable waies for ſetling the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and ſetling the power where it ought to be for the Honour and ſafety both of King and Subjects.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Argile</hi> oppoſeth all wayes of the Peace, &amp; ſettlement of the three Kingdoms, His Majeſties deliverance, and being brought to a Perſonal Treaty, leſt the power ſhould be taken out of his and his Confederates hands whereby they oppreſs and ruine both King and Subject.</p>
                  <p>The Duke hath uſed, and is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all endeavours to Vindicate the oppreſſed Subjects in both Kingdoms, never changing Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, being alwaies faithfull to all thoſe to whom he did profeſs love and friendſhip.</p>
                  <p n="7">7.

                  <p>having ſpoken to thee in the <hi>Firſt Part,</hi> I might have forborn thee in this <hi>Second,</hi> did I not feare to ſeem guilty of the fullenneſſe and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of theſe times. The ſubject-matter of my Book is a Combination or Faction of <hi>Pſeudo-Polititians,</hi> and <hi>Pſeudo-Theologicians, Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> both in Divinity and Policy; who, having ſacrificed to their Fancies, Luſts, Ambition, and Avarice, both their God and Religion, their King and Country, our Laws, Liberties and Properties, all duties Divine and Humane, are grown ſo far in love with their proſperous Sins, as to entitle God himſelf to be Father and Author of them: from whoſe written Word and revealed Will held forth to us in the Scriptures as the only North Pole and Cynoſure of our Actions (where they find no warrant for their doing) they appeal to the ſecret Will and Providence of God, to which they moſt Turkiſhly and Heatheniſhly aſcribe all their enormities, only becauſe they ſucceed: and from that Abyſſe of Gods Providence, draw ſecondary principles of Neceſſity and Honeſt Intentions; to build the <hi>Babel</hi> of their confuſed Deſignes and Actions upon; not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that wicked Men perform the ſecret Will a God to their Damnition; as good Men do the known Will of their Father to their Salvation; If a Man lie ſick to death, and his Son wiſh him dead, this is Sin in the Son, although his deſire concur with the Secret Will of God, becauſe the Son ought to deſire the preſervation of his Fathers life;

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36662:117"/> binding to the Perſons and Eſtates of the People in an Arbitrary way, to their utter enſlaving: <hi>To ſweare to Aboliſh Biſhops, &amp;c.</hi> was againſt his Coronation-Oath, <hi>To ſware to extirpate Hereſies, Schiſmes, &amp;c,</hi> is more then the Independents would permit; <hi>To ſweare to maintaine the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion between the two Nations,</hi> which the Parliament declare already to be <hi>broken by the Scots Invaſion,</hi> is vaine: beſides, how unjuſt a thing was it to impoſe that Oath upon the King, when moſt Members of the Parliament, Army, and others, are left at large not to take it?

This is a Principle, or new light diſcovered by Major <hi>Huntington, That it is lawfull to paſſe through any formes of Government, for accompliſhment of their ends, and therefore either to purge the Houſes, and ſupport the remaining Party by power everlaſtingly, or put a period to them by force:</hi> and themſelves imploy as much in this Remonſtrance, <hi>p.</hi> 45. ſaying, <hi>It cannot be ſafe to accommodate with the King, becauſe if He returne, and this Parliament continue long and unlimited, He will make a Party amongſt them; He hath bid faire for it among the Commons already, and the Lords are his owne out of Queſtion; and therefore we dare not truſt the King amongſt them.</hi> Againe they ſay, <hi>That if the King come into the Parliament, He will be looked upon as the Repairer of breaches, Reſtorer of trade, peace, plenty, &amp;c. and if the Army ſhould keep up (as it muſt) upon Taxes, the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Army will be looked upon as Oppreſſors; and the jealouſies and diſcontents of the People be increaſed againſt them, and make them apt to joyne iſſue with the Kings intereſt, and may yeild us up a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to appeaſe the King and his Party;</hi> out of theſe words, and their owne practice, I concluded for them, <hi>ergo,</hi> They may carry on their deſigne upon neceſſity for ſelf-preſervation, againſt the Monarchical Government, and Law of the Land, to <hi>murder the KING,</hi> as they have ſince done.

Theſe popular principles are meer empty notions, whereby the Grandees draw the Supreme Authority thorow the People to themſelves, the better to enſlave them; for the liberty of the Commons doth not conſiſt in a licentiouſneſſe to interrupt the Government of their Superiours, and change the Government according to their fancies; but the liberty of the People conſiſts in the enjoying the fruits of their labours, their goods, poſſeſſions, eſtates, and their perſonal liberty, according to the knowne Lawes of the Land. When <hi>Harry Martyn</hi> in <hi>Barkſhire</hi> forbade the People <hi>to ſtand bare at the Seſſions, and doe homage and fealty to their Lords;</hi> he gulled them; and gave them that which was not their due, to rob them of that which was their due; their Horſes, Goods, Money, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from them, for ſervice of the State (forſooth) and beat them that defended their owne; ſo that while he flattered them to be the Supreme Authority and Lords Paramount, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to be their Servants; he uſed them like Slaves conquered by the Parliament.

                  <p>About <hi>Decemb.</hi> 11. 1648.<note place="margin">35. The Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> was delivered into the world a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Beggers Brat, called <hi>[The Agreement of the People.]</hi> It is very judiciouſly Anſwered by Mr. <hi>William Aſhurſt;</hi> all the Contents thereof is in the <hi>Remonſtrance of the Army.</hi> 20. <hi>Nov.</hi> 1648. wherof I have ſpoken already.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It propoſeth, <hi>That the People</hi> (that is, ſome ſmall part of the People, the Army and their faction) without any colour of Law or Right <hi>ſhould agree together to take away finally the preſent Government by King, Lords, and Commons,</hi> which the Kings Party heretofore charged upon the Parliament as their Deſigne for which they fought, whereupon, the Parliament to vindicate themſelves, publiſhed many Declarations, and paſſed ſundry Votes, <hi>That they would not alter the Government by King, Lords, and Commons;</hi> it alſo takes away the legall right from Burroughs to chuſe members of Parliament; this admitted, they may as well conſpire to take away any Law, or any mans Life or Eſtate, by which rule we could enjoy nothing but as the will of any number of men that ſhall call themſelves <hi>The People.</hi> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame ground that thoſe that ſhall ſubſcribe this <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:36662:129"/> may call themſelves <hi>the People,</hi> may thoſe that ſhall refuſe to ſubſcribe call themſelves <hi>the People,</hi> and upon far better grounds, as being farre the more numerous, and ſtanding for defence of thoſe ancient Lawes, which do conſtitute the People and Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> which will breed infinite confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and diviſions: and what thoſe that call themſelves <hi>the People</hi> now agree to, they may alter upon the next change of humour or intereſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The inconveniences of the preſent Government have not yet been plainly diſcovered, nor no Trial hath been made by the preſent knowne legal power of <hi>England;</hi> whether thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences may not be removed without ſubverting the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government, and introducing ſo totall a change as will be very dangerous and grievous to all ſorts and conditions of men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the Proteſtation, <hi>May</hi> 5. 1641. and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Septemb.</hi> 27. 1643. we are bound to defend Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to oppoſe and bring to puniſhment all ſuch as ſhall endeavour the ſubverſion of Parliaments, which this Agreement cleerly doth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Agreement encroacheth deſperately upon the liberty of the People of <hi>England,</hi> in the Election of this Repreſentative; depriving them that have conſtantly adhered to this Parliament as wel as the Kings Party (if they cannot in conſcience ſubſcribe it) from Electing, or being Elected; yet they ſhall have Laws and Taxes impoſed upon them by Subſcribers, who are the leaſt, and the leaſt conſiderable party of the Kingdome, and upon whom they conferre no truſt; which is to disfranchiſe the Nonſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and reduce them to the condition of Conquered Slaves. It is a knowne Maxime in Law, <hi>Quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus tractae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni debet,</hi> what concernes all men muſt be debated and agreed to by all men, either perſonally or repreſentatively.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It will raiſe factions and feuds between the Subſcribers and Non-ſubſcribers of the Parliament party.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It takes away Magiſtracy and Government, not onely by placing ſuch a Supreme power over them as is diſputable; nay, apparently illegal: But by making the heady multitude <hi>(the People)</hi> ſupreme Judges over the ſaid Repreſentative: for although it inflicts the penalty of death upon the Reſiſters of their Orders;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36662:129"/> yet is with this <hi>ſalvo,</hi> except ſuch Repreſentative ſhall expreſly violate this Agreement, which makes every man or number of men that ſhall get power into their hands Judges of it; nor is there any other Judge deſigned: and (if there were) who ſhall judge that Judge? <hi>&amp; ſic in infinitum,</hi> the legal ſupreme Truſt of all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique intereſts being taken away, our vagabond thoughts wander in a circle, not knowing where to repoſe our truſt, all Judges, all Councels may erre, but the raſcal multitude are the very ſinke of errors and corruptions. If therefore the Supreme, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative have ſo unſtable an authority, what ſhall the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Magiſtrate acting under them have?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It ſmels ſo much of the Jeſuite, that it tolerateth Popery in private Houſes; contrary to the knowne Lawes of the Land: Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery (like the old Serpent) if it once get in the head, will ſoon inſinuate the whole body, being ſo well backed by Potent Princes and Councels from beyond Sea. And truly I know not what to ſay againſt Popery, where Hereſie, Schiſme, Atheiſme, and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie are openly tolerated, and exempted from the power of the civil Magiſtrate, as in this Agreement.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It will loſe <hi>Ireland;</hi> the managing of the Warre there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing legally in this Parliament by Act paſſed, not in this newfang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Repreſentative.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It divides us from <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. It deſtroyes the Cauſe for which the Parliament ſo often Declared, Voted, Proteſted and Covenanted that they fought, viz. <hi>Defence of Parliaments, Religion, Lawes and Liberties,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes the Cauſe upon the King, as if He only (from the beginning) had fought for them: which all men have reaſon to believe, when they ſhall ſee the Parliament make ſuch ill uſe of their Victory, as to root them all up. And this and all other Parliament-Armies were Commiſſioned <hi>to preſerve this Parliament;</hi> by this Authority they have their Pay and Indemnity, without which they are Thieves, Rebels, and Murderers.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. It demands, that there be no Lawyers nor Lawes, but new Rules in Engliſh to be made from time to time by the new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, who are to be choſen and truſted onely by a ſmall faction of Subſcribers, (as hath been ſaid) according to which juſtice ſhall be adminiſtred, not by Mayors, Sheriffs, Juſtices of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36662:130"/> the peace, Officers alwaies ready, but by hundred Courts, who are to ſupply the roome of all the Judges and Lawyers of the Kingdome: and all this to lie in the breſts of 12. Men in every Hundred (of the Tribe of the Godly be ſure) who peradventure can neither write nor read, nor have reſponſible Eſtates to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie wrongs done: theſe ſhall doe juſtice by providence and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</p>
                  <p n="12">12. It deſtroyeth all great and publique Intereſts (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot ſtand) Kings, Lords, Souldiers, Magiſtrates, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Lawyers, Miniſters, who will oppoſe it, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds and deſtroyes Religion, and depriveth the Miniſtery of its lot, Tythes: ſtopping their mouthes with famine, purpoſely to caſt them off: and generally all men of quality and diſcretion will withſtand it; becauſe it gives no ſecurity for enjoyment of liberty and property, nor for increaſe of learning, civility, and piety; who then are left to owne and ſubſcribe it but deſperate forlorne Perſons, who, becauſe they cannot bring their actions under the protection of our preſent Laws and Government, will bring the Laws and Government to their own corrupt wills and intereſts, and therefore will ſigne this <hi>Agreement:</hi> no obedience being given to this Repreſentative, but upon condition <hi>(that they kept this Agreement)</hi> and their being no other Judges of their keeping it but the Subſcribers; who in the reſult of all, hath the Law in their owne Wills.</p>

You hear likewiſe what was prayed in behalf of the People, That you ſhould give an Anſwer to that charge: You were then pleaſed to make ſome ſcruples concerning the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Court, and knew not by what Authority You were brought hither: You did diverſe times propound your Queſtions, and were as often Anſwered, That it was by Authority of the Commons of</hi> England, <hi>Aſſembled in Parliament, that did think fit to call You to account for thoſe High and capitall Miſdemeanours, wherewith You were then charged.

                  <p>Charles Stuart, <hi>King of</hi> England, <hi>You are accuſed in behalfe of the Commons of</hi> England <hi>of diverſe high Crimes and Treaſons; which Charge hath been Read unto You, The Court now requires You to give Your poſitive and finall Anſwer, by way of confeſſion or deniall of the Charge.</hi>

                        <hi>Sir, I ſay againe to you, ſo that I may give ſatisfaction to the People of England, of the clearneſſe of My proceedings, not by way of anſwer, not in this way, but to ſatisfie them that I have done nothing againſt that Truſt that hath been committed to Me, I would do it; but to acknowledge a New Court againſt their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, to alter the fundamentall Lawes of the Kingdome, Sir, you muſt excuſe me,</hi>

Hereupon the Court (that they may not be wanting to themſelves, nor the Trust repoſed in them, nor that any mans willfulneſſe prevent Juſtice) they have conſidered of the charge, of the contumacy, and of that confeſſion which in Law doth ariſe on that contumacy, they have likewiſe conſidered the notiority of the Fact charged upon this Priſoner; and upon the whole matter, they are reſolved, and have agreed upon a Sentence to be pronounced against this Priſoner, but in respect He doth deſire to be heard before the Sentence be Read, and pronounced, the Court hath reſolved to hear Him; yet Sir, thus much I must tell you beforehand, (which you have been minded of at other Courts) that if that which you have to ſay, be to offer any debate concerning the Juriſdiction, You are not to be heard in it: You have offered it formerly, and you have ſtruck at the root,</hi> that is, <hi>the Power and Supreme Authority of the Commons of</hi> England, <hi>which this Court will not admit a Debate of: and which indeed is an irrationall thing in them to do, being a Court that act upon Authority derived from them. But Sir, if you have any thing to ſay in defence of your ſelf concerning the matter charged, the Court hath given me in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to hear You.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Since I ſee that you will not heare any thing of debate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that which I confeſſe I thought most materiall, for the peace of the Kingdome, and for the liberty of the Subject, I ſhall wave it; but only I muſt tell you, that this many a day all things have been taken
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:36662:158"/> away from Me, but that, that I call dearer to Me than My life, which is My Conſcience and Mine Honour: and if I had a respect of my life, more than the peace of the Kingdome, and the liberty of the Subject, certainly I ſhould have made a particular defence for My life, for by that at leaſtwiſe, I might have delayed an ugly Sentence, which I believe will paſſe upon Me, therefore certainly Sir, as a man that hath ſome underſtanding, ſome knowledge of the world (if that my true zeale to my Country had not overborne the care that I have for My owne preſervation) I ſhould have gone another way to worke than that I have done: Now Sir, I conceive that a hasty Sentence once paſſed may ſooner be repented of than recalled; and truely, the ſelf-ſame deſire that I have for the peace of the Kingdome and the liberty of the Subject, more than My owne particular ends, makes Me n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The King preſſed again and again, that He might be heard by

But the duty I owe to God in the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36662:161"/> preſervation of the true Liberty of my people, will not ſuffer Me at this time to be ſilent: For, how can any free-borne Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>England</hi> call life or any thing he poſſeſſeth his owne, if power without right dayly make new, and abrogate the old fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Law of the Land. which I now take to be the preſent caſe. Wherefore when I came hither, I expected that you would have endeavoured to have ſatisfied Me concerning theſe grounds, which hinder Me to anſwer to your pretended Impeachment; but ſince I ſee that nothing I can ſay will move you to it (though Negatives are not ſo naturally proved as Affirmatives) yet I will ſhew you the Reaſon why I am confident you cannot judge Me, nor indeed the meaneſt man in <hi>England;</hi> for I will not (like you) without ſhewing a Reaſon, ſeek to impoſe a beliefe upon My Subjects.</p>

Now I am moſt confident, that this daies proceeding cannot be warranted by Gods Law, for on the contrary the authority of obedience unto Kings is clearly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted and ſtrictly commanded both in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which if denyed, I am ready inſtantly to prove: and for the queſtion now in hand, there it is ſaid, That <hi>where the word of a King is, there is Power; and who may ſay unto him, what doest thou?

But how the Houſe of Commons can erect a Court of Judicature, which was never one it ſelf (as is well known to all Lawyers) I leave to God and the World to judge; And it were full as ſtrange that they ſhould pretend to make Lawes without King or Lords Houſe, to any that have heard ſpeak of the Lawes of <hi>England.</hi>

I was ſuddenly ſurpriſed, and hurried from thence as a Priſoner, upon which accompt I am againſt my will brought hither, where ſince I am come, I cannot but to My power defend the ancient Laws and Liberties of this Kingdome, together with My owne juſt Right, then for any thing I can ſee the higher Houſe is totally excluded.</p>

                                 <p n="1">1. THat the whole Houſe of Commons in no Age had any Power, Right or Lawfull Authority to make any Valid or binding Act or Ordinance of Parliament; or to impoſe any Tax, Oath, Forfeiture, or capitall puniſhment upon any Perſon or
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:36662:170"/> Free-men of this Realme, without the <hi>Lords</hi> or <hi>Kings concurrent</hi> aſſents: much leſſe then can a ſmall remnant onely of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Houſe do it, ſitting under an armed force (which nulls and vacates all their <hi>Votes</hi> and proceedings, as the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of 20. <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1647. declares) whilſt moſt of their Fellow-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are forcibly detained and driven thence, as Mr. <hi>St. John</hi> proves in his Speech concerning Ship-mony, <hi>p.</hi> 33. and in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the Earle of <hi>Strafford's</hi> Attainder, <hi>p.</hi> 70, 71, 76, 77, 78. and Sir <hi>Edw.

                     </gap> and here lyeth the fallacy; he likewiſe moved, <hi>That the ſecured and ſecluded Members might again be invited into the Houſe:</hi> they ſent their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents both Lay-men and Miniſters (amongſt whom Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, Nye, Carrell, Goodwin,</hi> and <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> were chief) to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jole and decoy the Miniſters, Citizens, and the expulſed Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, with diſcourſes and propoſitions, they told them, The Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians had differed from the King in point of civil Intereſt, which was more irreconcileable than that Intereſt of Church-Government, whatſoever ſhew was made to the contrary, (They
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:36662:187"/> will not endure to hear of the KING'S exemplary patience and Chriſtian charity to all; nor of His precepts and ſtrict injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to His Son of clemency and abſtinency from revenge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in His laſt Book, <hi>[The Pourtraicture of His Majeſtie.]</hi> Theſe things will both apologize for our young King, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn our bloody vindicative Saints.) That the Presbyterians as well as the Independents made War againſt the late King, brought Him low, and prepared Him to receive his late deadly Blow from the Independents, and therefore the King would look upon both parties as equally guilty, and was deeply enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in point of Intereſt to cut off both Parties: Endeavouring by theſe diſcourſes to put the Presbyterians into <hi>deſpaire</hi> (their own and <hi>Judas</hi>'s ſin) and then to work upon that baſe and coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly principle of <hi>ſelf-preſervation,</hi> and invite them to joyn with them in point of civil Intereſt and common Defence. But their kindneſs was but like that of a malicious Man, who having plague-ſores upon him, embraceth his friend rather to infect then cheriſh him: they know that by ſitting, voting, acting, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with them, (whoſe actions the Laws of God and the Land have damned and anathematized with the higheſt condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) they ſhould contract the guilt of all their forepaſſed crimes and treaſons; in the mean time the Presbyterians ſhould ſit and act but as a ſuſpected Party, and ſhould be baffled and turned out again when the danger is paſt; the Independents keeping in their own hands all the power, profits and preferments of the Land, and uſing the Presbyterian party but as <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> Hewers of wood, and Drawers of water under them; they invited them therefore to ſhare with them in their ſins, ſhames, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but would keep <hi>Achans</hi> Wedge and the Babiloniſh gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (the profit of their crimes) to themſelves: And (as if it were not ſufficient to couſen Man without mocking God) the Houſe of Commons Ordered a <hi>ſtrict Faſt to be kept upon Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> 19 April 1649. <hi>as a day of Humiliation to implore Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs for the ingratitude of the people, who did not ſufficiently acknowledge with thankfulneſs Gods great mercies upon this Land in freeing them from Monarchie, and beſtowing libertie upon them, by changing Kingly Government into a Free-State or Republique.</hi> The Faction knew that to partake with them in theſe prayers,

                                 <p>ALL worthy Officers and Souldiers who are yet mindfull that you engaged not as a meer mercenarie Armie, hired to ſerve the Arbitrarie ends of a Councel of State; but took up Arms in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conſcience in behalf of your own, and the peoples juſt Rights and Liberties, you may ſee plainly by the proceedings of Col. <hi>Hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> with his Regiment, that the deſign of your grand Officers is, to reduce the Army to a meer mercenary and ſervile temper, that ſhall obey all their commands, without ſo much as asking a queſtion for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake. Intending by this blind obedience in you to make you be whatſoever they ſhall find requiſite to eſtabliſh their own abſolute power over the Common-wealth, yea, though it be to cut off your beſt friends, or perpetuate this their own Parliament and Councel of State, things ſo evidently deſtructive to your own and the peoples juſt Rights and Liberties as nothing can be more.</p>

                                 <p>And for compaſsing whereof, you know they have long ſince diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the Agitators, and erected a Councel amongſt themſelves, by which they have moulded the Parliament and a Councel of State to their own wills; both which, are to be as a ſcreen between the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and your Grandees, to make the world beleeve, they do nothing but by Order of Parliament, and Councel of State, when they order all things themſelves; and indeed are confederated together to defend and protect each others in their defrauding and enſlaving the Common-wealth.</p>
                                 <p>This they have long aimed at, but cannot poſsibly effect it, untill they reduce the Army to a ſervile and baſe temper, which they have been laboring to bring to paſs along time; as by picking quarrels with moſt Officers and Souldiers, that have manifested any ſence of Common Right, and ſo vexing them and wearying them out of Troops and Companie. And (you know) they have bin more than once disbanding twenty of a Troop, upon pretence of eaſing the publike charge all their miſchief being ever done, after either fasting and prayer, or upon ſome very ſpecious pretence; but the care and reſolution of the honeſt Ofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Souldiers ever prevented this.</p>
                                 <p>But now the buſineſs for <hi>Ireland</hi> (it ſeems) muſt doe the deed; that being a ſervice that muſt be preferred before the ſetling of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Freedoms of this Nation; and all that are not for this ſervice muſt be eſteemed no better than Enemies and Traitors; and therefore an <hi>Ahab-like</hi> Faſt goeth before the Lots are caſt: And Col. <hi>Hewſon</hi> falls to worke and disbands all thoſe Souldiers and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that refuſed to engage for the ſervice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> before the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>England</hi> (which we never trod under foot) be reſtored to the people.</p>
                                 <p>The end of this being to be a leading caſe to all other Regiments both Horſe and Foot; not that they certainly intend for <hi>Ireland,</hi> but by ſuch mans to be rid of all ſuch as are apt to deſire to be ſatisfied in their Conſciences of the juſtice of the Cauſe before they engage in the killing and ſlaying of men any more; or before they ſee ſome fruits anſwerable to the blood that hath been ſpilt.</p>
                                 <p>And being rid of this kind of Officers and Souldiers, then to fill the Regiments as this <hi>Hewſon</hi> doth, with ſuch ignorant, needy, or ſervile men, as theſe miſerable times (through loſs of Trade) have begotten.</p>
                                 <p>And this being done, then to make more ſtrict enquiry after this

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:36662:189"/> is an Abrogation and Nullment of all Acts, Orders, or Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by that Authority as to them: And upon this Account, your Excellency with the Army, long proceeded upon the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a new Councel and Government, contrary to all Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Law and Diſcipline, by whom only the Army engaged to be Ordered in their proſecution of the Ends; to wit, Their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rights, both as Souldiers and Commoners, for which they aſſociated; Declaring, Agreeing, and Promiſing each other, not to Disband, Divide, or ſuffer themſelves to be Disbanded or Divided, without ſatisfaction and ſecurity in relation to their Grievances and Deſires in behalf of themſelves and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as ſhould be agreed unto by their Councel of Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators: And by vertue, and under colour of this Eſtabliſhment, all the Extraordinary Actions by your Excellency, your Officers, and the Army have paſt: Your refuſal to disband, diſputing the Orders of Parliament: Impeachment and Ejection of Eleven Members; your firſt and ſecond march up to <hi>London;</hi> your late violent Excluſion of the major part of Members out of the Houſe, and their Impriſonment without cauſe, &amp;c. which can no way be juſtified from the guilt of the higheſt Treaſon, but in the accompliſhment of a righteous end, <hi>viz.</hi> The enjoyment of the benefit of our Lawes and Liberties which we hoped long ere this to have enjoyed from your hands: Yet when we conſider and herewith compare many of your late carriages both towards the Souldiery, and other free people, and principally your cruell Exerciſe of Martial Law, even to the Sentence and Execution of Death upon ſuch of your Souldiers as ſtand for the Rights of that Engagement, &amp;c. And not onely ſo, but againſt others not of the Army; we cannot but look upon your defection and Apoſtacy in ſuch dealings, as of moſt dangerous Conſequence to all the Laws and Freedoms of the People.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, although there had never been any ſuch ſolemn Engagement by the Army, as that of <hi>Iune</hi> 5. 1647. which with your Excellency in point of duty ought not to be of the meaneſt obligation. We do proteſt againſt your Exerciſe of Martial Law, againſt any whomſoever, in times of Peace: where all Courts of Iuſtice are open, as the greateſt encroachment upon our Lawes and Liberties that can be acted againſt us; and particularly, againſt
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:36662:189"/> the Tryall of the Souldiers of Captaine <hi>Savages</hi> Troop yeſterday, by a Court Martial, upon the Articles of Warre, and ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of two of them to death; and for no other end (as we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand) but for ſome diſpute about their Pay: And the reaſon of this our Proteſtation, is from the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> made in the third yeare of the late King, which declareth, <hi>That no perſon ought to be judged by Law Martial, except in times of Warre; And that all Commiſſions given to execute Martial Law in time of Peace, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Lawes and Statutes of the Land.</hi> And it was the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments complaint, That Martial Law was then Commanded to be executed upon Souldiers for Robbery, Mutiny, or Murder. Which <hi>Petition</hi> of Right this preſent Parliament in their late De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of the 9. of <hi>February,</hi> and the 17. of <hi>March,</hi> 1648. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend as the moſt excellenteſt Law in <hi>England,</hi> and there promiſe to preſerve inviolably, it, and all other the Fundamental Lawes and Liberties, concerning the preſervation of the Lives, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and Liberties of the People, with all things incident ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.

And if the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority may not preſume to do this, much leſſe may You, or Your Officers preſume thereupon; For where Remedy may be had by an ordinary courſe in Law, the Party greived ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have his recourſe to extraordinaries. Whence it is evident, That it is the undoubted Right of every Engliſhman (Souldier, or other) that he ſhould be puniſhable onely in the ordinary Courts of Juſtice, according to the Lawes and Statutes of the Realme in the times of Peace, as now it is; and the extraordinary way by Courts Martial, in no wiſe to be uſed.</p>

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:36662:192"/> in behalf of their Common Right, Freedom, and Safety, hath bin at all obſerved, or made good, but both abſolutely declined and broken, and the people only ſerved with bare words and faire promiſing Papers, and left utterly deſtitute of all help or delivery: And that this hath principally been by the prevalency and treachery of ſome eminent perſons (now domineering over the people) is moſt evident.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> His Majeſty in yielding to this Grant, had reference to two ends: 1.

An Army of 30000. Horſe and Foot effective againſt Him. 2. When He was endangered and tired out with a long and cloſe Impriſonment. 3. When many dangerous and menacing Petitions againſt His life, had been encouraged and entertained: ſo that the King may ſeem to have been neceſſitated to yield to this Grant for His own juſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful defence.</p>

In the Bill for continuance of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>there ſeemes to be ſome reſtraint of the Royal power in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of Parliaments; not to take it out of the Crown, but to ſuſpend the execution of it for this time,</hi> and occaſion onely, which was ſo neceſſary for the Kings own Security, and the Publick Peace, that without it we could not have undertaken any of thoſe great Charges, but muſt have left both Armies to diſorder and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The very Title of this Act [an Act to prevent inconveniences which may happen by the untimely Adjourning, Proroguing, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of this preſent Parliament] intimates as much, compared with the body of it, which provides as well againſt the Adjourning, or Proroguing without an Act, as againſt a Diſſolution. Now the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament cannot be ſaid to be Adjourned, or Prorogued untimely by the Kings Death (which never Adjourned, or Prorogued any Parliament) but onely by his Proclamation, Writ, or Royal Command to the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or their Speaker executed during his life-time,</hi> See Parl.

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The Prologue of the Act implies as much, whereas great ſumms of Money muſt of neceſſity be ſpeedily advanced</hi> for relief of His Majeſties Army (not his Heir or Succeſſor) and for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying other His Majeſties (not his Heires, nor Succeſſors) oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, which cannot be ſo timely effected as is requiſite, without credit for raiſing the ſaid Monies; which credit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained until ſuch Obſtacles be firſt removed, as are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by Fears and Jealouſies; <hi>That this Parliament may be Adjourned, Prorogued, or Diſſolved, before Juſtice ſhall be duly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:36662:219"/> upon Delinquents</hi> (then in being, as <hi>Strafford, Canterbury,</hi> not ſince made) <hi>Publique Grievances</hi> (then complained of, as Star-chamber, High Commiſſion, Ship-money, Knighthood-money, Tonnage, and Poundage, &amp;c.) redreſſed: <hi>Peace concluded</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Nations, <hi>ſufficient proviſions made for repayment</hi> of the ſaid monies (not others ſince) ſo to be raiſed. <hi>All which expreſſions related onely to His late Majeſty, as to His Acts of Royal Power, not to His Heires and Succeſſors, after His Natural (much leſs) Violent death,</hi> which was not then thought on, but publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deteſted, and Proteſted againſt; no Man being ſo hardy as to mention it for fear of the Law, not then ſubdued by the Sword; And the ſeveral Principal Scopes of this Act are fully ſatisfied long before the late Kings death.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>It is clear by the Body of this Act;</hi> And be it declared, &amp;c. That this preſent Parliament, &amp;c. <hi>ſhall not be diſſolved, unleſs it be by Act of Parliament to be paſſed for that purpoſe; nor ſhall at any time,</hi> or times during this preſent Parliament, <hi>be Adjourned, or Prorogued,</hi> unleſs it be by Act of Parliament to be paſſed for that purpoſe; and that the Houſe of Peers ſhall not at any time, or times, during this preſent Parliament, be Adjourned, unleſs it be by themſelves, or by their own Order.

But when the Army (by confederacy with their party in the Houſe) took the boldneſs to increaſe their number without Order, 60000 l. a month, was thought abundantly ſufficient to pay the Army, and take off Free-quarter: And why this Tax ſhould now be raiſed to 90000 l. a month, when ſundry Regiments of it are Aſſigned for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and yet Free-quarter continued, is a myſtery of Iniquity which fills the Saints pockets with Mony, and all the World with Wonder.</p>

The ſaid agreement made between the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monarchical Independent Party in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the maſſacring Antimonarchical Popiſh party under <hi>Owen Roe O Neale</hi> (being a meer conſpiracy to root out Monarchy and Proteſtancy: firſt, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and then in <hi>England:</hi> and a ſecond crucifying of Chriſt in his members between two Thieves, the Schiſmatick and the Papiſt) was ſo generally abhorred by the Engliſh Souldiery, that many there took occaſion to forſake the Engliſh Parliament; and many here disbanded rather than they would accompany <hi>Cromwel</hi> in ſo wicked an expedition. Wherefore <hi>Cromwel</hi> writ Letters to his Creatures of the Councel of State by <hi>Monck</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, complaining how much the miſcarriage of that Agreement had retarded his ſaid Voyage; deſiring them (for ſatisfaction of the Souldiery and People) to Treat with <hi>Monck</hi> to take the whole buſineſſe upon himſelf, and to clear the Councel of State, the Parliament, and <hi>Cromwel</hi> himſelf, from having any hand at all in it, which upon Terms of ſafety and advantage (he ſaid) he already found him inclinable to do. The better to carry on the ſcene, this Agreement was with much heat of zeal complained of in the Apocryphal Houſe of Commons by a Brother who had his cue before-hand, and by the Juncto was referred to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of State as was forelaid, where their High and Mightineſſes (after ſome private conference with <hi>Monck</hi> to accommodate the buſineſs) voted their diſlike of it:<note place="margin">

                              </opener>
                              <p>YOu may wonder, my Obligations being ſo great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, that my returns of acknowledgment ſhould be ſo ſeldom as they have been, but you muſt know there is no defect in my deſires to be at your eares often; 'tis only the preſervation of my Liberty and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in theſe parts that makes me forbear the frequencie of ſuch intercourſes. I am confident theſe Letters, this Meſſenger, and the incloſed papers which I here ſend you (containing a true Copie of the Propoſitions and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Agreement between <hi>Owen Roe O Neale,</hi> and Col. <hi>George Monck</hi>) will be able to give you ſome account of the paſſages in theſe parts, and will make you aſſured that I do not forget the reſpects I owe unto you.</p>
                              <p>I muſt confeſs to you that (as you ever conceived) I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could imagine that the Parliament proceedings would have advanced to ſo high a degree of rage and wickedneſs as I ſee now they are come to, and are reſolved to act by: but being amazed at the KING'S Murther, and ſeeing the Gangrene doth ſo cruelly ſpread, I will impart to you my
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:36662:227"/> reſolution, That I am reſolved to get into your parts with the firſt conveniency, and adhere to you there, whoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are more conducing to the preſervation of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Law, and common Intereſt, than any where elſe that I can find. But that this my ſo ſudden reſolution may not be conceived the fruit of ſome vain fear, miſcarriage in my ſelf, or light deſires to abandon my former principles, I ſhall give you a right underſtanding of all the motions and paſſages of my ſoul, ſince I was acquainted with this late Treaty between Col. <hi>Monck,</hi> and <hi>Owen Roe O Neal,</hi> that thereby you may judge of the ground of theſe my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and diſtaſtes, and my reſolutions taken thereupon.</p>
                              <p>And before I conſider the particulars of the Treaty, the thing it ſelf is ſo odious to me, that if they could have made the best bargain to be imagined for the Engliſh Safety, the manner of it would have appeared to me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unſavoury.</p>
                              <p>For although it cannot be denied that almoſt the whole Iriſh Party (in regard of their Confederacies and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations) have not been innocent in all particulars of that vaſt Ocean of Engliſh Blood that hath been ſhed; yet it is moſt clear, that the Plotters and Contrivers of this Treaſon, and the unnatural and butcherly Executioners thereof are that Party principally which are now Headed by <hi>Owen O Neale;</hi> for, although many of the pale, with others of <hi>Conaught, Leinſter,</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi> entertained the Deſigne, when they ſaw it was ſo far ſpread, and the Engliſh ſo much weakned in their perſons and poſſeſſions, yet it cannot be denied but this Kingdom had ſtill many moderate-minded Men that loathed their Countrymens barbarity, and could never be drawn to adhere to their Party in their leaſt conſent.</p>
                              <p>Now for the Parliament Agents to gather up theſe Men
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:36662:228"/> (and theſe onely) that have been drunk with the blood of their Brethren, and to fortifie them with Arms, Councels, and conjunction of Forces, that thereby they may preſerve to themſelves the Triumphs of their Cruelty and Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to lap them up in their affections with promiſes of reward, if they will perſevere to act with them the ruine of the KING and Monarchy, the deſtruction of the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Engliſh Proteſtants, and the ancient Iriſh who have now declared their Loyalty, and ſubmitted to, and conſociated with them, are things that I much loath, and can no way embrace.</p>
                              <p>Beſides, if you conſider the paſſages of the Treaty, you will eaſily be drawn (I ſuppoſe) to caſt away your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer entertained ſcruples, and not condemn me for being out of love with mine.</p>

All which directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, councels, and aſſurances (I am confident) Col. <hi>Monke</hi> would not have uſed towards him, if he had not had a Parliament foundation to warrant it.</p>
                              <p>Thus you ſee theſe Men who lately were utter Enemies, have confederated together to ruine Monarchy, and the Proteſtant Religion, meerly to raiſe themſelves, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their own Faction.

Col. <hi>Morrice</hi> (who kept <hi>Pontefract Castle</hi> for the <hi>King</hi>) was Endicted before Judge <hi>Thorpe</hi> and <hi>Pulleſton</hi> at <hi>Yorke</hi> Aſſizes upon the <hi>Stat.</hi> 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>for leavying War againſt the late King and Parliament.</hi> The Colonel challenged one <hi>Brook</hi> (Forerman of the Jury) for being his profeſſed Enemy; but the Court (knowing <hi>Brook</hi> to be the principal Verb, the Key of their work) anſwered <hi>Morrice,</hi> He ſpake too late, <hi>Brooks</hi> was ſworn already. <hi>Brook</hi> being asked the Queſtion, whether hee were ſworn or no: replied, he had not yet kiſſed the Book. The Court anſwered, It was no matter, that was but a Ceremony, alleadging he was recorded Sworn, there was no ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Record; Sure they made great haſte to record him ſworn before he could kiſs the Book; ſo <hi>Brooke</hi> was kept in upon this cavil, by whoſe obſtinacy, <hi>Morrice</hi> was condemned. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wonder that legal Forms and Ceremonies are laid by (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though juſtice cannot ſubſiſt without thoſe Legalities to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her proceedings, which otherwaies would be left at large to the diſcretion of the Judge) when I ſee our known Laws, <hi>Magna Charta, the Petition of Right.</hi> 3 <hi>Carol.</hi> and the reſt, with the fundamental Government of this Nation, pulled up by the roots to carry on their Deſigns of enſlaving the people to their luſts, notwithſtanding the Parliaments Declarations, Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, Proteſtations, Covenants, and Oaths to the contrary; and their late Vote in the Act for Aboliſhing Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That in all things concerning the Lives, Liberties, Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Eſtates of the people, they would obſerve the known Laws of the Land. But to return to our Relation: Then <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> challenged 16. more of the Jury, where <hi>Pulleſton</hi> was ſo pettiſh, that he bad <hi>Morrice</hi> keep his compaſs, or elſe he would give him ſuch a blow as ſhould ſtrike off his head. Until <hi>Morice</hi> cited the <hi>Stat.</hi> 14 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>fol.</hi> 19. whereby he might challenge 35. men without ſhewing cauſe: Here you ſee the Judges (which ought to be of Councel with the priſoner in matter of Law) endeavouring to out-face, and blind the priſoner with ignorance
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:36662:233"/> of the Law, being a Martial-man. Then he deſired a Copy of his <hi>Endictment,</hi> that he might know what to anſwer, ſaying, he might plead Speeial as well as General, which the Court denied him. Next becauſe there was point of Law in it, he deſired to have Councel, citing the <hi>Stat.</hi> 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>fol.</hi> 23. which was likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him; yet (I am deceived, if <hi>Rolfe</hi> had not Councel allowed him, being endicted at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> for <hi>an endeavour to murder</hi> King <hi>CHARLES the Firſt</hi>) and had many other favours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to <hi>Morrice.</hi> Then Col. <hi>Morrice</hi> for his diſcharge produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>PRINCES</hi> Commiſſion as <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> to the <hi>KING</hi> his Father. The Judges anſwered, The Prince was but a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as <hi>Morrice</hi> was, and if he were preſent muſt be tried as he was, and rejected the Gommiſſion without reading: <hi>Morrice</hi> told them, the Prince had his Authority from the King, in whoſe name all Judges and Officers did then Act. The Court anſwered, the power was not in the King, but the Kingdome. Obſerve, they endicted him for Leavying War againſt the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. The word <hi>[Parliament]</hi> was a ſurpluſage; for which no Indictment could lye: no Allegiance, no Treaſon; and we owe Allegiance to the King alone; whoſoever Leavieth War in <hi>England</hi> (in the intendment of the Law) is ſaid to Leavy War againſt the King onely; although he aim not at his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but at ſome other Perſon: And if he that Leavieth War againſt the King, his Crown, and Dignity, be a Traytor; how much more muſt they be Traytors that have actually murthered the King, and Diſ-inherited and proſcribed his lawful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Heir; and (as much as in them lies) have ſubverted the Monarchical Government of the Land, and conſequently all Monarchical Laws; whereof the <hi>Stat.</hi> of <hi>Treaſons</hi> for Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying War againſt the Kings Majeſty is one; and therefore <hi>Morrice</hi> under a Free-State ought not to be condemned or tried upon any Monarchical Law. So <hi>Morrice</hi> was found guilty by a Jury for that purpoſe.

                     <p>Theſe things being but Introductions to the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of theſe Kinglings: and having been already ſhewed to the world by many pens.

                     <p>The firſt endeavour of all Tyrannical Uſurpers is, To leſſen the number of their Enemies; either by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36662:247"/> flattering and deceiving them: or by violently extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating and rooting them out. And ſuch have been the attempts of our new <hi>Cromwellian</hi> Statiſts, ever ſince (without any calling from God or the people) they took upon them the Supreme Authority of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſubverted our well-mixed Monarchy, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves a Free-State</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They endeavoured to ſweeten and allure to act with them,<note place="margin">1.

But this Deſign fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the moſt part.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Their ſecond Endeavour was how to diminiſh the number of their Oppoſites,<note place="margin">2.

But fame prevented this plot: which coming to be the common rumour of the Town, put them in mind of the danger, infamy, and hatred that would overwhelm them. So this was laid aſide.</p>

And contrary to the Oathes of Allegiance, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Supremacy: whereby (and by the Stat. of Recognition, 1 <hi>Jac.</hi>) our <hi>Allegiance</hi> is tied onely
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36662:248"/> to the <hi>King,</hi> his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>lawful Suceeſſors;</hi> from which no power on earth can abſolve us, and ſo much we atteſt in the Oath of Supremacy. <hi>Politicus</hi> (Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter to our new State-puppet play) <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. from <hi>Sept.</hi> 19. to <hi>Sept.</hi> 26. out of the dictates of his Maſters tells us, that in Anſwer to the Kings Act of oblivion granted, the Parliament intends to paſs an Act of General pardon; for which they expect in future a General obedience and ſubmiſſion to the Government (you ſee though they will not be the Kings ſubjects, they will be his Apes) and in the beginning of the ſaid Pamphlet, <hi>Politicus</hi> ſaith, That Protection implies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, otherwiſe they may be handled as publick Enemies and Out-laws, and ought to be deſtroyed as Traitors. Here you have the end to which this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pardon is intended; it is but a ſhooing-horn to draw on the utmoſt penalty upon Non-engagers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the ſaid pretended Act 2. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1649. to weed them out of this good Land, that the Saints on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may enjoy the earth and the fulneſs thereof; to which purpoſe all their new coyned Acts and Laws are directed. The Scripture points forth theſe kind of men, when it ſaith, <hi>The Mercies of the wicked are cruel.</hi> The ſum of all is, If we will not acknowledge Allegiance to theſe Muſhromes, we ſhall be Traitors without Allegiance (a Treaſon never yet heard of in any Law) If we will acknowledge Allegiance, we put our ſelves in a capacity to be Traitors, when they ſhall pleaſe to make us ſuch. But let them know, That we are all Engliſhmen, Free-born alike, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of an ancient, legal Monarchy, to which we owe Allegeance; and how we come to forfeit that legal Protection, our ſetled Laws
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36662:249"/> and Government; and be ſubjected to a New, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known protection obtruded upon us by a company of upſtarts (Muſhromes of Majeſty, ſo mean in birth and breeding (for the moſt part) that the place of a Conſtable equalls the higheſt of their education) impoſing what Laws and conditions upon us they pleaſe; I would be glad to hear without being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by Guns, Drums, High Courts of Juſtice, and other Inſtruments of Violence and Murther. But the greateſt Myſtery in this cheat is, That our Self-created Supremiſts, having voted the original power to be in the people, and but a derivative Authority to be in themſelves as the Repreſentative of the people, ſhould notwithſtanding ſo yoak their Sovereign Lord the people, and make them pay Allegiance to their own Delegates (the eighth part of a Houſe of Commons) under the penalty unleſs they ſubſcribe as the far major part have not) of out-lawing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving all the people of this Land of all benefit of the Laws they were born to; and conſequently of annihilating and making them no longer a Nation or people. As if they were meer Salvages, newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, collected and formed into a politick body or Commonwealth, and endowed with Laws newly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the Novice Statiſts. But the unlawfulneſs of the ſaid Engagement with the Injuſtice of the Self-created power that obtrudeth it hath been hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by many good pens, eſpecially by the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Miniſters in their plea for Non-ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Therefore I paſs on to my principal ſcope; <hi>The ſecond Engine appointed to root out all ſuch as are of a different party, the High Court of Juſtice.</hi> A for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Monſter, upon which no pen (that I know of) hath yet adventured.</p>

Nor <hi>ſuch as Schiſmatically or Heretically affected, are ſeaſoned with ſuch Doctrines and Principles, as neither agree with the Duties of a good Chriſtian, a good Common-wealths man, nor a good Judge.</hi> Which two laſt Objections not only theſe Commiſſioners, but the pretended Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that commiſſioned them are apparently guilty of, as being all of the Independent Faction conſpiring to rob and rout out all other Parties: Royalliſts, Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Levellers: For which purpoſe this New Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall or Inquiſition is ſet up. <hi>Independency being a meer complication and Syncretiſmus, or rather a Sink and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sewer of all Errours, Hereſies, Blaſphemies, and Schiſmes, (though they peeviſhly differ in ſome inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tenents) yet having one Generall End or ſcope at which they all chiefly aime</hi> (viz.) <hi>power, preferment, profit, and the ſuppreſsion of the Truth and Magistracy, they have likewiſe ſome common principles to ſoader them together, which they uſe as a Meanes conducing to that Generall End.</hi> Some few whereof I will here ſet down for my Readers ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. 1. <hi>To tollerate no King nor Magiſtrate Superior to themſelves,</hi> as Being a Tyranny or Bondage over the Chriſtian Liberty of the Saints and Kingdom of Chriſt. Becauſe they know no Chriſtian Magiſtrate can tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate them, being (by the <hi>Genius</hi> of their Sect)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36662:253"/> enemies to all Civil Societies, whether Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Ariſtocraticall, Democraticall or Mixed; as the Kingdom of England was before theſe men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed it. Beſides their common Doctrine, <hi>That they are appointed to break the powers of the Earth to pieces, To levell the hils and fill up the vallies, That they are called, To bruiſe the Nations with a rod of Iron, and break them in pieces like a Potters veſſell:</hi> Which they have done in <hi>England,</hi> and threaten the like in <hi>France, Germany,</hi> &amp;c. whereof, their Pulpits and diſcourſes ſound. Obſerve <hi>their Practiſes in the Low Countries.</hi> Where having by their ſpies and Emiſſaries, found out ſome Burgers of the ſame humour with themſelves; They propagated their Doctrine ſo far; as to endeavour to ſtrike the Ariſtocraticall Members out of that Common-wealth by abetting ſome of the States Provinciall to leſſen (and ſo to aboliſh by degrees) The Lords States Generall (the Optimates of that State) To ruine the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to whoſe Family they owe their Liberty; <hi>To diſſolve the Generall Union of the ſaid United Provinces, and ſo take in pieces the whole Frame of that Republick.</hi> To ſay nothing of their Inſolencies in fighting and killing their men, becauſe the Belgike Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will not ſtrike ſaile to their Croſſe and Harpe; and in blowing up the Antelope in Helverſluce: Which ſhews what good Neighbours <hi>Holland,</hi> and other Parts, are like to have of the New State of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> (when they have made themſelves intire by the purchaſe of <hi>Scotland</hi>) that is born (like our Engliſh <hi>Richard</hi> III.) with Teeth in its head; and ſnappeth at its Neighbours before it be out of its Swadling clouts. This is the cauſe that <hi>Cromwell,</hi> before he ſet ſaile for <hi>Ireland,</hi> cauſed his Journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36662:254"/> the pretended Parliament. To paſſe an Act for Tolleration of all Errors, Hereſies and Schiſmes, under the Notion of Liberty of Conſcience, and Eaſe for Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſciences. 2. Their ſecond Principle is, <hi>That the Good things of this World belong onely to the Saints (that is; Themſelves) all others being uſurpers thereof: and therefore they may rob, plunder, ſequeſter, extort, cheat and confiſcate (by illegal Laws of their own making, by extrajudicial Courts and partial Judges of their own conſtituting) other mens goods and eſtates, upon as good Title as the Jews ſpoyled the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, or expelled the Canaanites.</hi> 3. Their third Principle. <hi>That the Spirit (which ſanctifies and illuminates theſe men) in every particular man blowes when and where it will, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this way, ſometimes that way, often contrary waies: And therefore they can make no profeſsion of any certain Rule of Doctrine or Diſcipline, becauſe they know not which way the Spirit will inſpire.</hi> For this reaſon they are ſtill pulling down old and ſetting up New Doctrines, as the <hi>Nomades</hi> do cottages, onely conſtant in unconſtancy. They profeſſe their conſciences are the Rule and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boll both of their Faith and Doctrine, by this Leaden Lesbian Rule they interpret, and to this they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Scriptures; not their Conſciences to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; ſetting the Sun-Dyall by the clock; not the clock by the Sun-Dyall. That every man muſt pray according to the Dictates of his Private Spirit; They reject the Lords Prayer, for fear of quenching the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>When they break their Faith, Articles, Promiſes, Declarations and Covenant; they Alleage, the Spirit is the Author thereof.</hi> When <hi>Cromwell</hi> (contrary to his vowes and Proteſtations made to the King) kept him cloſe Priſoner in Carisbrook Caſtle; He affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>the Spirit would not let him keep his word.</hi> When,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36662:254"/> contrary to the Publick Faith, they Murdered Him: they pretended: <hi>They could not reſiſt the Motions of the Spirit. Sua cuique Deus fit dira libido.</hi> This Hobgoblin ſerves all turnes. 4. Their fourth Principle is, <hi>That they may commit any ſin, and retain their Sanctity in the very Act of ſinning: For what is ſinfull in other men, is not ſo in the Saints; who may commit any crime againſt the Law of God, and yet it cannot be imputed to them for ſin;</hi> Becauſe they know in their Conſciences what they do. So ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and delicate are their Conſciences, That <hi>they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any Offence againſt their Neighbour, without breach of Juſtice or Charity.</hi> A righteous man is a Law to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. 5. Their fift Principle is, <hi>That</hi> 7. <hi>make a Church: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though men, women and children, and that this Church is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent upon any other.</hi> The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> (though they neither profeſſe to follow <hi>Paul</hi> nor <hi>Cephas</hi>) yet declare themſelves to be ſome of <hi>Cromwells</hi> Church, ſome of <hi>John Goodwins,</hi> ſome of <hi>Kiffins,</hi> ſome of <hi>Patiences,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Carters</hi> Church. 6. Their ſixt Independent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is. <hi>That if a man be queſtioned for any crime, though his Judges have neither competent witneſſes, proofs nor Evidence of his guiltineſſe, yet if they think in their Conſciences he his guilty; they may condemn him out of the Testimony of their own Private Conſciences.</hi> Is it not fit men ſo Principled ſhould be Judges and Jury too; and condemn men by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration? So Colonel <hi>Andrews</hi> and Sir <hi>John Gell</hi> were condemned; for <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Pits</hi> (witneſſes againſt them) were apparently ſuborned by <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay</hi> againſt them, and forſworn in the ſame cauſe; and good proof offered to the Court, that they were both Flagitious men, of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous life and converſation. The letter (ſuppoſed to be ſent by <hi>Andrews</hi> to <hi>Gell</hi>) was delivered to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36662:255"/> 
                        <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> whereof <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ſent a Copy onely to <hi>Gell</hi> at 10. of the clock at night; and had a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant then ready to arreſt <hi>Gell,</hi> which was done earely next morning before he could conveniently diſcover it: Yet was <hi>Gell</hi> ſentenced for Miſpriſion of High Treaſon. See Sir <hi>John Gells</hi> caſe ſtated <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1650. with Colonel <hi>Andrews</hi> Atteſtation (in his behalf) under his hand a little before his death. And though Sir <hi>John</hi> was Impeached and Mr. Atturney proſecuted him onely for Miſpriſion; yet had he much ado to keep that bloud-thirſty, old cur <hi>Keeble</hi> from taking a leap at his throat, and giving Judgement againſt him for High Treaſon. So for want of Law Sir <hi>John</hi> had like to be hanged by Inſpiration and Inſtinct of the Spirit. He that will ſee more of the Independent Tenets, Let him read <hi>Cl. Salmaſius</hi> chapter 10. <hi>Defenſionis Regiae, Elenchus Motuum nuperorum in Anglia.</hi> And the Hiſtory of Independency firſt and ſecond part. Theſe 6. I have ſelected, that by comparing their Doctrine with their daily Practiſe, the Reader may perceive what pious Chriſtians, good Patriots, and upright Judges, theſe engaged, Independent Commiſſioners of the High Court of Juſtice are like to prove. The builders of this New Common-wealth or Babel, hold forth to the People, Juſtice and Liberty, as their Motto: as if thoſe excellent gifts had never received their birth, nor been ſo much as ſhewen to the People untill they murdered the King, and ſtepped into his Throne. But how righteous a <hi>Free-State</hi> or Common-wealth is this like to be? And how well are the People therein likely to be inſtructed in the waies of Righteouſneſſe, Juſtice and Charity, and improved in good life and converſation, by men ſo principled as aforeſaid, Let
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36662:255"/> the world judge. Eſpecially when they obſerve, That our New Statiſts have enacted in the ſaid pretended Act. 2. <hi>January,</hi> 1649. enjoyning the Engagement, That whoſoever will promiſe Truth and fidelity to them by ſubſcribing the Engagement may deal falſely and fraudulently with all the world beſides. And break all Bonds, Aſſurances and Contracts made with Non-engagers, concerning their Eſtates; and pay their Debts by pleading in Bar of all Actions, That the complaint hath not taken the Engagement: This is to rob the Egyptians of the good things of this world, This is to break their Faith by the Motions of the Spirit, This is to cheat and rob their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours without breach of Charity or Juſtice, and without imputation of Sin according to their aforeſaid Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I am come now to conſider in the third place, <hi>The way and Manner of their proceedings;</hi> How conſonant they are to the uſuall proceedings of our known Lawes, and Legall Courts of Judicature; (the beſt Inheritance of all Freemen) whereof ſee Colonel <hi>Andrews</hi> 3. Anſwers in his Defence given into the ſaid High Court, herewith printed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt courſe they commonly take is; To break open mens Houſes, Studies, Cheſts, &amp;c. and ſeiſe their Papers; and thereby hunt for Matter of Charge againſt them: And then to examine them againſt themſelves, upon the ſaid Papers, contrary to <hi>Magna Charta</hi> which ſaith, <hi>Nemo tenetur prodere ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſum.</hi> And contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, which forbids a man to deſtroy his own life, or be, <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> as many men unwittingly do, who anſwer to captious, enſnaring queſtions. When that tempting
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36662:256"/> queſtion was put to Chriſt; <hi>Art thou the King of the Jews?</hi> He returned no other Anſwer then <hi>Thou ſayest it: Why askeſt thou me?</hi> Ask them <hi>that heard me,</hi> That is, Ask witneſſes. It was objected againſt the Oath <hi>ex Officio,</hi> That it was High Injuſtice to examine a man againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Becauſe his Anſwers may only ſerve to condemn, but not to acquit him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They uſually break open houſes with Souldiers, at all houres of the night, pulling men out of their beds with great violence and Terrour, and ſo carry them away, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence whereof Robberies and Murders have been committed, Whereas by the Stat. 1. Ed. VI. chap. 12. and 5. and 6. Ed. VI. chap. 11. A man ought not to be accuſed of High Treaſon but to one of the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; or to one of the Kings Juſtices of the Aſſize; or to one of the Kings Juſtices of the Peace being of the <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum:</hi> or to 2. Juſtices of the Peace where the Offence is committed. <hi>Cooks</hi> 3. <hi>Inſtit. chap.</hi> High Treaſon, <hi>pag.</hi> 26. 27, 28.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They Commit men to Priſon without any Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation or Accuſor made known, and during pleaſure: and detain them in Priſon many yeares together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Legall proceedings or Charge againſt them; ſharing their Eſtates, Offices and Revenues (by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtrations and Suſpenſions of the Profits) amongſt themſelves; without any Crime objected: And ſo leave them to ſtarve, rot and dye in naſty Gaoles for want of Maintenance, under the cruelty of covetous and mercileſſe Gaolers, whom they bear out (for mony) in all their Extortions. And being thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned and wounded with the diſpleaſure of the State, no man dares adventure, upon any ſecurity, to lend him money for fear of incurring the disfavour
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36662:256"/> of the State, and a Note of Malignancy,<note place="margin">Witneſs about 3000. Scottiſh Priſoners of War ſtarved to death at Durham: where they eate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Theſe were taken at the battle of Dunbar on. 1650. 3. Sept. and many hundred Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners have been murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Gaoles, with hunger, cold, naſtineſs and contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after they have been robbed of their Eſtates and no Crime laid to their Charge: this is become a daily practiſe.</note> whereby their Priſons are become private Slaughter-houſes, as well as their Courts Publick ſhambles of Injuſtice. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in the Tower of London (To which priſon no Goale-delivery belongs) were alwaies wont in the time of <hi>(that ſuppoſed Tyrant)</hi> King Charles I. and his Predeceſſors, to have allowance from the King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeverall degrees; As 5 l. a weeke for an Eſquire, &amp;c. although the King deprived them of no part of their Eſtates untill conviction, and this Maintenance was provided for them by the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Tower; and in reſpect of his care and paines in procuring it he had Fees, and not otherwiſe, though now they continue and encreaſe the ſaid Fees; the cauſe being taken away the effect ceaſeth not. But theſe men now in power, after they have Committed men and robbed them of their Eſtates, without cauſe ſhewen, are ſo far from giving them any allowance to feed them; that they ſhut them up cloſe Priſoners in unwholſome Chambers, denying them the Liberty of the Tower, and the benefit of freſh Aire (the Cameleons Diet) for their health, and reſort of friends, for their accommodation. And that they may be ſure to <hi>deprive them of all legall meanes by</hi> habeas corpus <hi>to recover their liberties;</hi> They Commit men by <hi>illegall warrants</hi> not expreſſing any particular Offence or cauſe for their Commitment: ſo that it is impoſſible for the keeper of the priſon to obey the <hi>habeas corpus,</hi> which is directed to him in theſe words: <hi>Praecipimus tibi quod corpus A. B. unâ cum cauſa detentionis ſuae, habeas coram nobis, &amp;c. ad recipiendum ea quae curia noſtra, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon the Gaoler or Sheriff is to bring his Priſoner to the Bar, and tender his <hi>mittimus</hi> to the Court,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36662:257"/> ſhewing the particular cauſe of his Impriſonment, that the Court may judge whether it be Legall, or no. <hi>Dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus verſatur in Generalibus.</hi> In the Acts of the Apoſtles, chap. 25. verſ. 26, 27. <hi>Feſtus</hi> thought it unreaſonable to ſend <hi>Paul</hi> a priſoner to <hi>Ceſar</hi> (to whom he had appealed) and not withall to ſignifie the Crimes laid to his Charge. See Cooks 2. Inſtit. fol. 591.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Their uſuall Courſe of <hi>practiſing and ſuborning witneſſes, tempting them with hopes and terrifying them with fears,</hi> is ſo notorious; That it is known the Counſell of State have hundreds of <hi>Spies and Intelligencers, Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit-men and Knights of the Poſt,</hi> ſwarming over all England as Lice and Frogs did in Egypt: and have both <hi>Penſions and ſet rates for every Pole brought in: So that now the whole Nation is proſcribed, and every mans head ſet to ſale,</hi> and made a ſtaple commodity, (far beyond the definite Proſcriptions of <hi>Silla</hi> and the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid) Theſe Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> are ſent forth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the earth ſeeking whom they may devour. Theſe, (with the Liberty of Priviledged Spies) ſpeak bold language to draw other men into danger: and plot conſpiracies, which themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, and are rewarded like Decoy Duckes for their paines. Of this ſort are <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Pits</hi> ſet no work to betray <hi>Gell</hi> and <hi>Andrewes,</hi> as aforeſaid.

So well are they fitted with theſe Sonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> that no <hi>Naboth</hi> can keep his Vineyard, if a Grandee caſt a covetous eye upon it; they can prove what they liſt. Nay it is uſuall for our Grandees to moleſt one man with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36662:257"/> examining him 20. or 30. ſeverall times, againſt one Priſoner, and upon one point, to diſtract his memory, and not to let him be quiet untill he perceive he muſt ſpeak what their queſtions and diſcourſes lead him to, to redeem himſelf from vexation.

Juſtice not fixed by Formalities, will become ſuch a vagrant, that no man ſhall know where to find her.</hi> Let us now ſee what our new ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, our upſtart High Court doth. Which in this work of Reformation and Deſtruction, ſo much abhorres Superſtition and Ceremonies, and ſticks ſo cloſe to a Summary way of proceeding, that they have not onely ſtripped, but flead her: as their Maſters the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament not onely fleece but flea the People.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36662:259"/> their Maſters and Pay-Maſters have precondemned. Next <hi>Articles of Impeachment in nature of a charge</hi> are drawn up againſt the Priſoner (although ſuch Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are nothing in Law, which regards onely a Bill of Inditement) Then the Priſoner (after a cloſe Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for he knows not what) upon two daies warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is led to the Bar; where the firſt work is to dazle his eyes, amaze and diſtract his Judgement and Memory with the terror of their Souldiers, the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merouſneſſe, high affronting words and looks of his Judges; having thus mortified the Priſoner, he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to hear his charge read: and bid <hi>plead to it, Guilty, or not Guilty.</hi> If he own their Juriſdiction and plead the ſaid Generall Plea, they have him where they would have him: they never ask him; how he will be tried, Whether by God and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?

Or whether we ſhould have one King, Governing by the known eſtabliſhed Laws? or 40 Tyrants Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning by their own luſts and arbitrary votes, againſt our written Laws?

                  <p>It is ſaid of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> that, though they acknowledged no providence, nor any immortality of the ſoul, and propoſed pleaſure as the only end of their lives, yet they maintained (most of them) that they that were lovers of pleaſure, muſt of neceſſity be lovers of Justice, and that without virtue it was not poſſible for men to live in true pleaſure, So as it was ſaid of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> (who were for the most part notable hypocrites) that they ſpoke good things, and did foul actions, but that the <hi>Epicureans</hi> ſpoke and taught things that ſeemed foul and ſhamefull, but did that which was fair and honest.</p>
                  <p>Certenly theſe two ſects of Phyloſophers might be the very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel of our late times, wherein our Stoicall Grandees could ſpeak nothing but holineſs, where the practice of their lives was a continued ſeries of horrid Treaſons, while a litle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent mirth and freeneſs of ſpeech was the greateſt that lay, or indeed could be caſt, upon integrity of their deſpiſed Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts: ſo that we might ſee <hi>Cucullus non fecit Monarchum.</hi>

Now might you have ſeen <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate</hi> reconciled, and both againſt Chriſt: Thoſe two reſtleſs and adverſe factions, the Presbyterian and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent faction, could joyn together, both in their armes, and prayers againſt his ſacred Majeſty, belching forth the ſcandalous language of their ulcerous tongues to incenſe the People, and bring them into frenzy againſt thoſe few poor deſpiſed loyall ones, &amp; ſo indeed they did; thoſe very pretended Miniſters not only preaching, but largely contributing to the raiſing of more forces from day to day, yea ſome of them going in perſon to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſinate the poor incloſed Royaliſts, who yet reſolved, that though they foreſaw their ruine, as not being able without a miracle to cope with ſuch an innumerable multitude, they would ſell their lives at a dear rate, and make ſome of the purchaſers at leaſt ſhare in an equall fate with them, and ſo in truth they did.

But <hi>Actum est,</hi> their end is concluded, the decree is gone forth: ſo after ſeverall routs and rallies, a generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat ſucceeds with the death of between 4000. and 5000. and about 7000. or 8000. taken priſoners, the purſuite being both hotly and eagerly purſued, each villain hoping to enrich himſelf by ſeizing on the Royal pray. But Heaven had ſent a Guardian Angell to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him, that at length he may once more come and be the reſtorer, both of our peace, Religion, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.

                  <p>This being, by his Officers I ſay, preſented to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and by him in a letter communicated to the Speaker, he marcheth into <hi>London,</hi> and taketh quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, declaring for a free Parliament; and this blow was it,<note place="margin">Free <hi>P.</hi> promiſed</note> made Independency ſtagger, for ſo highly were both City and Country pleaſed with this Declaration, that they did hardly know in what manner to expreſs their joy, ringing their bells, making bonfires, the air reſounding nothing but the name and prayſes of <hi>Monck,</hi> and the Streets filled with gratefull hearts, who on bended knees prayed for bleſſings on the head of the hoped reſtorer, both of the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and in this reſolution he perſiſted, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the flatteries, threatnings and ſnares of the houſe, who now ſtudied nothing more than his ruine, as in him foreſeeing their own, nevertheleſs he waits for the Parliaments anſwer to his laſt letters to them, but finding they neither minded him nor them, and thought of nothing but ſetling their own intereſt, and continuing themſelves in power, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures a conference between ſome ſitting members of the houſe, and ſome of the honourable Gentlemen and worthy Patriots that were excluded from it, at which himſelf being in perſon preſent, and weighing ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly

                  <p>The ſecluded members being thus admitted,<note place="margin">How they begin and wherein proceed.</note> fall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to work where they were abruptly forced to break of in <hi>December.</hi> 1648.

                  <p>This began to infuſe a new ſpirit of life into the Kingdom, in whom at this ſpringing ſeaſon of the year, began a new to bud and peep out the bloomes of a too long froſt-nipped loyalty, ſo that one now might have ſeen what twenty years before could never ſhew, countenances, that lately were dejected through the cruell tyranny of their Aegipitian task maſters, now ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cheerfull looks, and like freſh blown roſes yield a fragant ſavour.</p>

                  <p>Thus ſetling the ancient Government of the City, and vacating the Phanatick power in the Country, they commend the eſtabliſhment of the Nation to a full and free Parliament, to be called the 25th. of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill,</hi> 1660.

                  <p>So reſtleſs were the Nights of our pious King, that he began to account all time ſpent in vain and amiſſe, wherein he did not do or offer ſome good to his Kingdome: to this purpoſe, on the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> (the very next day but one after his Arrival, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with his two Brothers and Sir <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> with many other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable perſons, went by water to the Houſe of Lords, where having ſeated himſelf in his Royal ſeat, the Black Rod was ſent to the Commons to inform them of his being there: They immediately adjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and with their Speaker, waited his Majeſties pleaſure, who in a ſhort ſpeech acquainted them with the Occaſion and Cauſe of his preſent ſending for them, <hi>viz.</hi> To paſs thoſe Bills which he underſtood were prepared for him; the ſaid Bills being therefore read according to ancient form by the Clerk of the Crown, were paſſed by his Majeſty,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Bill conſtituting the preſent Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be a Parliament.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, For Continuance of <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term and all proceedings at Law, which done the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hide</hi> in a pithy Speech, told both Houſes with how much readineſſe his Majeſty had paſſed theſe Acts and how willing they ſhould at all times hereafter find him, to paſs any other that might tend to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and benefit of the people, deſiring in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties behalf, the Bill of Oblivion to be ſpeeded, that the people might ſee and know his Majeſties ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gracious care to eaſe and free them from

                     <hi>Thomas Harriſon</hi> having received his Tryal, and being condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered, accordingly on <hi>Saturday</hi> betwixt nine and ten of the clock in the morning the thirteenth of <hi>October</hi> 1660, he was drawn upon a hurdle from <hi>Newgate,</hi> to the place that is rayled in by <hi>Charing-croſs,</hi> where a Gibbet was erected, and he hanged with his face looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Banqueting-houſe at <hi>White-hall</hi> (the fatal place pitched upon by thoſe infernal Regicides, for the ſolemn murther of our late Soveraign <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, of glorious memory) when he was half dead, the common Hangman cut him down, cut off his privy members before his eyes, then burned his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, ſevered his head from his body, and divided his body into four quarters, which were ſent back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame ſledge that carried it, to the priſon of <hi>Newgate,</hi> from thence his head was brought and ſet on a pole at the <hi>South</hi> end of <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward the City of <hi>London,</hi> but his Quarters are expoſed to view, as a publick example upon ſome of the Gates of the ſame City.</p>
                  <p>His pleading at his arraignment were nothing but treaſonable and ſeditious ſpeeches, rather juſtifying the crime he had committed, then any whit relenting; and ſo he continued a deſperate Schiſmatick to the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the laſt moment of his breath.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>John Carew</hi> was the next that followed, who at the time of his tryal, endevoured onely to juſtify the late Rump and their actings, but that would not ſerve his turn, for it was proved that he did conſult and meet together with others how to put the King to death, that he ſate at the time of the ſentence, and ſigned the Warrant for execution, ſo that the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:36662:340"/> Jury found him guilty of compaſſing and imagining the Kings death; for which he was alſo condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſentence on <hi>Monday</hi> the fifteenth of <hi>October,</hi> in the morning, was put in execution on the body of the ſaid <hi>Carew,</hi> his Quarters being likewiſe carried back on the Hurdle to <hi>Newgate;</hi> but ſuch was the goodneſs of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that upon the humble interceſſion of his friends, he was graciouſly pleaſed to give them his body to be buried, though his execrable treaſons had merited the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3, 4. The next in order, were Mr. <hi>John Coke</hi> the Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor, and Mr. <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> that Carnal Prophet, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical Chaplain to the trayterous High Court; upon <hi>Cooke</hi>'s Trial it was proved againſt him, that he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined witneſſes againſt the King, that he was at the drawing of the Charge, that he exhibited it in the name of the Commons aſſembled in Parliament, and the good people of <hi>England,</hi> that this Charge was of High Treaſon, that he complained of delayes, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Charge might be taken <hi>pro Confeſſo,</hi> and at laſt, that it was not ſo much he as innocent blood that demanded Juſtice, and that notwithſtanding all this, he acknowledged the King to be a gracious and wiſe King, upon which the Jury found him guilty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then <hi>Peters</hi> was ſet to the Bar, againſt whom was proved, that he did at five ſeveral places conſult about the Kings death, at <hi>Windſor,</hi> at <hi>Ware,</hi> in <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-ſtreet,</hi> in the <hi>Painted Chamber,</hi> and in <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>'s houſe, that he compared the King to <hi>Barrabas,</hi> and preached to binde their Kings in chaines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That he had been in <hi>New England,</hi> that he came thence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the King and foment war, that he had been in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:36662:341"/> arms, and called the day of his Majeſties Tryal a glorious day, reſembling the judging of the world by the Saints that he prayed for it in the <hi>Painted Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> preached for it at <hi>White-hall,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi>'s Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, St. <hi>Sepulchres,</hi> and other places: upon which proofes the Jury finding him guilty alſo, of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and imagining the Kings death, the Court ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced them, <hi>viz. (Cooke</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> both) to be led back to the place from whence they came, and from thence to be drawn upon a Hurdle to the place of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On <hi>Tueſday</hi> following, being the ſixteenth of <hi>October,</hi> they were drawn upon two Hurles to the rayled place near <hi>Charing-croſs,</hi> and executed in the ſame manner as the former, and their Quarters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the place whence they came: ſince which, the head of <hi>Iohn Cooke</hi> is ſet on a Pole on the <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt</hi> end of <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> (on the left of Mr. <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>) looking towards <hi>London;</hi> And the head of Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> is placed on <hi>London</hi> Bridge, their Quarters alſo being expoſed upon the tops of ſome of the Gates of the City.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The next brought to Tryal, were <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Clement, Scroope,</hi> and <hi>Iones;</hi> againſt <hi>Thomas Scot</hi> was proved, that he did ſit and conſult about the Kings death, that he agreed to the ſentence, and ſigned the Warrant, whereby the King was murthered, that ſince he hath owned the buſineſs of the Kings death, by glorying in it, defending it, and ſaying he would have it engraven on his Tomb-ſtone, that all the world might know it, which being high aggravations of his crime, he was ſoon found Guilty by the Jury.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Then <hi>Gregory Clement</hi> was ſet to the Bar, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately confeſſed himſelf Guilty, <hi>modo &amp; forma,</hi> and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:36662:341"/> ſo without troubling the Jury was ſet aſide till Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Next was brought Mr. <hi>Iohn Iones</hi> againſt whom the proofs were ſhort, that he did ſit upon the King in that monſtrous Court, and that he ſigned the Sentence and horrid Inſtrument whereby the King was ordered to be put to death, upon which the Jury found him guilty.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Then <hi>Scroop</hi> was tried upon the like Indictment for compaſſing the Kings death, and againſt him was proved that he ſate in the Court, and did Sentence the King, and ſign the bloody Warrant, and after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of his Majeſty that now is, juſtified the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of that deteſtable murther, for which the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry finding him guilty, the Court gave ſentence of death againſt them as the former to ſuffer as Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and accordingly on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 17. of <hi>October,</hi> about 9. of the clock in the morning. Mr. <hi>Thomas Scot,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gregory Clement</hi> were brought on ſeveral hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to the Gibbet erected near <hi>Charing-croſs,</hi> and were there hanged, bowelled and quartered, and about an houre after Mr. <hi>Adrian Scroop,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn Jones</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one hurdle were carried to the ſame place, and ſuffered the ſame pains of death, being afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and thence their quarters placed on ſeveral of the City Gates, and their heads deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly diſpoſed on the top of <hi>London</hi> Bridge and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places.</p>
                  <p>Theſe being thus diſpatched, &amp; having received the reward of their Treaſon, Mr. <hi>Daniel Axtel,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Francis Hacker</hi> were brought before the Court to be tried; Againſt the firſt of whom, <hi>viz. Axtell,</hi> was in proof, that is the imagining and compaſſing the death
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:36662:342"/> of the King, that he bid his Souldiers cry out Juſtice, Juſtice, and Execution, Execution; and beat them till they did it; That he bid ſhoot the Lady that ſpoke and call'd <hi>Cromwel</hi> Traytor, ſaying, not a quarter of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> conſented to their wicked Charge; that he ſaid to Col. <hi>Huncks</hi> upon his refuſal to ſign the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for executing the King: <hi>I am aſhamed of you, the Ship is now coming into Harbour, and will you ſtrike ſayle before we come to Anchor;</hi> that he laughed at the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, as applauding them while others ſighed; that after the King was murthered, he kept Guards upon the dead body, and knew who cut off the Kings head, having ſent one <hi>Eliſha Axtell</hi> for the Executioner; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which proof the Jury found him guilty of the ſaid Treaſon whereof he ſtood indicted.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Francis Hacker</hi> was arraigned, and by diverſe witneſſes it was ſworn againſt him, that he was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Halbeteers, who kept the King priſoner, and would not ſuffer any acceſſe to be unto him; that he guarded him to their mock-Court, and after kept him ſure till he was murthered; that he was one of the perſons to whom the Warrant for execution was dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and that he ſigned it, that he brought the King to the fatal block and was upon the ſcaffold, being a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal agent about the Kings death; for which horrid Treaſon the Jury found him guilty: after which the Court ſentenced both him and <hi>Axtell</hi> to ſuffer death as Traytors, according to which judgement they were on <hi>Friday</hi> the 19. of <hi>October,</hi> about 9. of the clock in the morning, drawn upon one hurdle from <hi>Newgate</hi> to the common place of execution, generally called <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and there were hanged. Mr. <hi>Axtel</hi> was bowelled and quartered and ſo returned back and diſpoſed as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36662:342"/> but the body of Mr. <hi>Hacker,</hi> by his Majeſties great grace and favour, and at the humble ſuit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of his friends was given to them entire, and by them afterwards buried.</p>
                  <p>The laſt of this crew that was for preſent execution was <hi>Will. Hulet,</hi> againſt whom was proved that he was one of thoſe which came with a Frock on his body, and a Vizor on his face to perpetrate the horrid murther on the Perſon of the King, and that being ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed upon the Scaffold, he fell down before the King and asked him forgiveneſſe, being known by his voice; that himſelf ſaid, He was the man that beheaded K. <hi>Charles,</hi> &amp; for that he had one 100 l. and preferment. That <hi>Hewſon</hi> ſaid of him that he did the Kings buſineſs upon the Scaffold; That he either did cut it off, or took it up and ſaid, Behold the head of a Traytor. That being queſtioned about the ſaid words, he ſaid, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſaid it matters not; I ſay now, it was the head of a Traytor, with many other things to the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for which moſt abhorred Treaſon, the Jury found him guilty, and he was condemned to be hang'd drawn and quarter'd at <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the deſerved Cataſtrophe that was ſet to theſe men, who without any reaſon, nay contrary to reaſon, Lawes both Divine and Humane, yea, even in defiance of Heaven, dipped their hands in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred blood of their lawful Soveraign, according to that of the Wiſeman, <hi>The eye that mocketh his Father,</hi> (Rex Pater Patriae) <hi>and deſpiſeth his Mother,</hi> (Eccleſia eſt Mater) <hi>the Ravens of the Valley ſhall pick it out;</hi> which which we ſee befallen them, their heads in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places being become a ſpectacle both to Angels and Men, and a prey to the Birds of the Aire.</p>

                     <p>HOw far the Treaſons of faction have reached, and how high they durſt ſoare is to be ſeen before, I ſhall onely now in ſhort give a hint how highly the Law of <hi>England</hi> reſents ſuch impious acts: I ſay then, the wiſdome and foreſight of the Laws of this Land in all caſes of Treaſon maketh this judgement: that the Subject that riſeth or rebelleth in forcible, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the royal will and power of the King, intendeth to deprive the King both of Crown and Life, and this is no myſtery or quidity of the Common Law, but an infallible concluſion drawn out of reaſon and experience; for the Crown is not a ceremony or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but as Imperial conſiſteth of preheminence and power. This made former Traytors in all their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels againſt their Princes, not to ſtrike down-right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God unto Lawful Kings did ever impart ſuch beams of his own glory, as Rebels never durſt look ſtraight upon them, but ever turned their pretences againſt ſome about them; this cauſed the Judges ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to deliver their opinions for matter in Law upon two points.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt, that in caſe where a ſubject attempteth to put himſelf into ſuch ſtrength as the King ſhall not be able to reſiſt him, and to force and compel the King to govern otherwiſe then according to his own royal authority and direction, it is manifeſt rebellion.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond, that in every Rebellion, the Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth as a conſequent, the compaſſing the death and deprivation of the King, as foregoing, that the rebel will never ſuffer that King to live or raign, which might puniſh or take revenge of his treaſon; And
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:36662:344"/> this is not onely the wiſdome of the Laws of our own Kingdome, but it is alſo the cenſure of forraign Laws, the concluſion of common reaſon, (which is the ground of Law) and the demonſtrative aſſertion of experience, which is the warranty of all reaſon.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the firſt the Civil Law, that ſaith, Treaſon is nothing elſe, but <hi>Crimen Laeſae vel dimminutae Majeſtatis,</hi> making every offence which abridgeth or hurteth the power and authority of the Prince, as an inſult or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading of the Crown, and extorting the imperial Scepter.</p>
                     <p>And for common reaſon and experience, they cry, it is not poſſible that a Subject ſhould once come to that height, as to give law to his Soveraign, but what with terror of his own guilt, and what with the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the change he will never permit the King if he can chuſe to recover his authority, nay or to live Experience further tells us, and 'tis confirmed by all ſtories and examples; two notable ones we had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in our own Chronicles, the firſt of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 2d. who when he kept himſelf cloſe for danger, was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by proclamation to come and take upon him the Government, but as ſoon as he preſented himſelf, was made priſoner, next forced to reſign, and ſhortly after; was tragically murthered in <hi>Berkly-Caſtle.</hi> The other is of K. <hi>Rich.</hi> the ſecond, before whom the Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> (afterwards K. <hi>Hen.</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with three ſeemingly humble, but indeed flattering reverences, yet in the end both depoſed him and put him to death: but our own experience outvies all elſe, in the Horrid murther of our late dread Soveraign, which is related in the former parts, the puniſhment whereof is fully related in this laſt part, and therefore I ſhall no more thereof in this place.</p>

                     <p>You may have obſerved that the practice of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicides was after they had ruined the Gentry, to advance their own kindred and allyes, though never ſo inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently unworthy, to the moſt profitable places of the Common wealth; by which means all kind of exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances were committed without controul, the Death of the King being attended with infinite oppreſſions, as in ſuch changes is uſual; which made Writers ſay, that the Death of <hi>Caeſar</hi> was no benefit to the Romans, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brought greater Calamities on them they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went befere, as may be found in <hi>Aſpian.</hi> The ſucceſs was the like when <hi>Nero</hi> fell, for the next year that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after his Death, felt more oppreſſion, and ſpilt more blood then was ſhed in all thoſe nine years where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had ſo tyrannically reigned. So when the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had expelled one Tyrant, they brought in thirty; and when the <hi>Romans</hi> expelled their King, they did not put away the Tyranny but only change the Tyrants.</p>
                     <p>But ſuch and ſo tender is the hand of heaven over us, that he hath not only reſtored our Kings as at the firſt, and all our Counſellors as at the beginning; but brought us home our King ſo accompliſhed and pious, that we muſt needs confeſſe with the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe the Lord hath a delight in us, therefore hath he made him King over us.</p>
                     <p>Oh then let us <hi>render</hi> without grudging <hi>unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſars,</hi> acknowledge him as Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Vicegerent, not preſcribing him in what manner we will be ruled, nor by what means: But in all things with obedience and humility to ſubmit to his command, like <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtata's Soldiers who would not ſacrifice at his words, <hi>ſed timendo poteſtatem, contemnebant poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> in fearing the power of God, they regarded not the power of man; yet when he led them againſt his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:36662:345"/> enemies, <hi>Subditi errant propter Dominum eternum, etiam Domino Temporali.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will conclude all with one word of Advice: Since God hath ſo bettered our condition, that our words are hardly able to expreſs our happineſſe, to avoyd the danger of a relapſe through a too careleſſe ſecurity, let circumſpection &amp; moderation take away all bitterneſſe, rather reflecting on the offences then the perſons of any offenders, ſo it may be thoſe concerned will not be ſo deſperate to proceed on further in their wicked courſes, but with ſpeed retire, and make ſome recompence to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for theſe Loyal hearts who have borne the brunt of the ſtorm both at home and abroad; ſince God hath reſcued them as brands out of the fire; 'tis hoped they will be nothing the more ſecure in their vigilant care of future occurrences, having alwayes a provident eye for the timely prevention of ſuch inconveniencies, as might ſteal on them in their own, or be intended againſt them from forrain parts. That ſo the Throne of our <hi>Solomon</hi> may continue for ever, and peace be upon our <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
